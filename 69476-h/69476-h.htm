<p class='c010'>Our readers will, no doubt, be interested by
the few particulars we have been able to collect
of the late wonderful discovery, in the interior
of New Holland, of a civilized nation of European
origin, which had, in so remarkable a
manner, been kept separate hitherto from the
rest of the civilized world.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Mr. Hopkins Sibthorpe, who planned and
conducted this singularly fortunate enterprise,
was accompanied, it appears, in the expedition
by another settler, Mr. William Jones, and
Messrs. Thomas and Robert Smith (brothers),
of the navy; who, together with Wilkins, a
sailor, hired as their servant, constituted the
whole party.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in the early part of August 1835
that these adventurous explorers took their departure
from the settlement at Bathurst: this,
as our readers are aware, is the last month
of the winter of that hemisphere; though, from
the greater mildness of the climate, it may be
considered as spring. This season was chosen
as the most suitable for an expedition in such a
country as New Holland; in which, not only
the heat of summer and autumn is often very
oppressive, but also the scarcity of water is one
of the most formidable impediments: and, on
this occasion, a plentiful supply of water being
essential, not only with a view to their personal
wants, but also to the accomplishment of the
peculiar plan they had resolved on trying, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>was thought best to take an early advantage of
the effects of the winter’s rains.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their plan was no other than to construct
a canoe, to enable them to proceed in a direction
in which farther progress had hitherto
been precluded by a vast expanse of marshy
lake. This, as our readers are probably aware,
from the published narratives of former expeditions,
is, in moist seasons, a sort of Mere, or
shallow water, encumbered with aquatic plants;
but in times of great drought is, for a considerable
extent, dry, or consisting of mud rather
than water; constituting a sort of swampy
plain, so choked up with a rank vegetation
of reeds and flags as to present an almost insuperable
obstacle to the traveller.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the present expedition, accordingly, it was
determined to choose a time when there might
be a sufficiency of water to enable the adventurous
explorers to proceed in a canoe; and
they accordingly carried with them one or two
horses (which they proposed afterwards to turn
loose)—the iron-work, and as much as was
thought necessary of the frame of a canoe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>which they proposed to put together and complete
on their arrival on the margin of the lake.
And as it was impossible to carry with them a
sufficient store of provisions for the whole of
their contemplated voyage, they boldly resolved
to trust in great measure to their guns and
fishing tackle, providing only a sufficiency of
salt to preserve such game and fish as they
might procure in their way.</p>

<p class='c011'>The details of the expedition, curious and
highly interesting as they are in themselves, we
are compelled to omit, lest they should occupy
the space wanted for a far more valuable and
important portion of the narrative. It will be
sufficient, therefore, to say, omitting particulars,
that they were enabled to put their design
in execution; and having constructed a kind
of light flat-bottomed boat, of poles covered
with bark (of the kind the natives use for their
canoes), and fitted up with a slight awning, to
afford shelter from the sun and the dews, they
embarked on the above-mentioned shallow lake,
and proceeded in a north-west direction; sometimes
rowing, assisted occasionally by a sail,
and oftener pushing themselves on with poles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>through the tangled aquatic plants which grew
on the muddy bottom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their progress was at first tediously slow;
but they were at no loss for provision, as the
waters abounded with fish and wildfowl, of
which they continued to obtain a sufficient supply
throughout the voyage. After two days
of troublesome navigation they found the water
become deeper, and gained a sight of some elevated
land towards the west, which they reached
on the evening of the third day: they here
found the lake not terminated, but confined
within narrow limits by hills, for the most part
of a rocky, sterile, and uninviting character:
at length it became a broad river, flowing in
a northerly direction, and serving evidently as
a drain to the great expanse of lake they had
passed. This gave them hopes of reaching
(which was their great object) some large navigable
river, which they might follow to the
sea: they proceeded, therefore, though with
considerable delay and difficulty from shoals
and rapids, till, after more than two days’ navigation,
the high ground receded, and they
found themselves entering on another great expanse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of water, so extensive that, in pursuing
their adventurous course nearly in the same
direction, they were, for the greater part of one
day, out of sight of land.</p>

<p class='c011'>They now arrived at another course of rocky
hills, of considerable elevation, through which
the waters found an exit by a narrow gorge:
through this they proceeded in a direction
northwards for a considerable distance, when
they found the river again expanding itself
at intervals into a chain of lakes, smaller but
deeper than those they had passed, and surrounded
by a much more agreeable country,
which continued to improve as they advanced.
They landed in several places, and in one instance
came in contact with a party of natives,
who were of a less savage aspect than those in
the vicinity of our settlements, and showed no
signs of hostility, and much less of alarm and
astonishment than had been expected. From
this circumstance, and also from steel knives
being in the possession of two or three of them,
on which they appeared to set great value, it
was conjectured that they must, in their wanderings,
have, at some time or other, approached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>our settlements: their language, however,
was perfectly unintelligible to Mr. Jones, though
he had a considerable acquaintance with that
of the natives near Sydney.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days after, as they continued their
progress, they fell in with another party of
natives, who excited still more wonder and speculation
in our travellers, from their having
among them ornaments evidently fashioned
from the tusks of boars; these (as it was understood
from the signs they made, in answer
to the questions put to them by the same
means) they described themselves as having
hunted with their dogs, and speared. But all
doubt was removed the next day, by the travellers
actually obtaining a sight of a wild hog
in the woods, and afterwards of a herd of wild
cattle, which they distinctly saw with their
glasses: these animals being well known not to
be indigenous in New Holland, afforded strong
indications of the vicinity of some European
settlement; though, as they felt certain of being
far distant from the coast, they were utterly
lost in conjecture.</p>

<p class='c011'>After proceeding in the manner above described,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>through a long chain of lakes connected
by the river which they were continuing
to navigate, through a country continually improving
in beauty and fertility, and presenting
a strong contrast to the dreary rocks and
marshes they had left behind, they were at
length surprised and gratified, on entering a
lake somewhat more extensive than the last,
to see several fishing-boats, the men in which
they ascertained by their glasses to be decently
clothed, and white men. They ventured to
approach and to hail them; and, to their unspeakable
surprise and delight, they received
an answer in English: the English was, indeed,
not precisely similar to their own, but
not differing so much from it as many of our
provincial dialects; and in a short time the
two parties were tolerably intelligible to each
other.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are compelled to pass over the interesting
detail of the meeting, which was equally
gratifying and surprising to both the parties;
of the eager curiosity of their mutual inquiries;
and of the hospitable invitation given, and,
as may be supposed, joyfully accepted by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>travellers. Accompanying their hosts in one
of the fishing-boats, they found before them,
on turning the point of a wooded promontory
which had intercepted their view, a rich and
partially cultivated country, interspersed with
cheerful-looking villages, having much of an
English air of comfort; though the whole was
in a far ruder condition than much of what
they saw afterwards, as the point they had
reached was the extreme skirt of a comparatively
recent settlement.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reception they met with was most
friendly and every way refreshing, after an
anxious and toilsome journey of above a month.
They found themselves, on the second day after
their arrival in the colony, the guests of the chief
magistrate of a neat town of considerable size,
where they were surrounded by visitors from
all parts, eager to obtain and to afford information,
and overwhelming them with pressing
invitations.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are compelled to pass over the particulars
of the several steps by which the travellers
arrived at the knowledge of the singular
country and people in the midst of which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>found themselves. We have only space for a
brief summary of the results.</p>

<p class='c011'>They found themselves, then, in a nation of
European, and chiefly, though not entirely, of
English extraction, which had had no intercourse
with Europe, or with any other portion
of the civilized world, for nearly three centuries.
Their numbers were estimated at between
three and four millions; and they were
divided into eleven distinct communities, existing
in a sort of loosely federal union, or rather
in a friendly relation, sanctioned and maintained
by custom more than by any formal compact.
And they found these several states,
though in some respects differing in their governments
and other institutions, agreeing in
the manifestation of a high degree of civilization,
considering the disadvantage they laboured
under in their seclusion from the rest of the
world. “Many points too,” says Mr. Sibthorpe,
in his journal, “in which they differ the most
widely from the customs and institutions of the
people from which they sprang, are such as can
hardly be reckoned marks of barbarism, even
by those who regard them with surprise, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>even with disapprobation; but are rather the
result of the singular and, as some would consider
them, whimsical notions of the extraordinary
persons who took the lead among the first
settlers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These were two men of the name of Müller;
one a German, settled in England, and the
other his nephew, the son of an Englishwoman.
The former appears to have been one of those
unions of enthusiastic wildness, brilliant genius,
and sanguine credulity which periods of great
excitement—such as the commencement of the
Reformation—are often found to call forth. He
possessed great eloquence, and a power of exercising
an unbounded influence over minds of
a certain description. His nephew, with much
of the uncle’s eccentricity, united a much clearer
judgment, and seems gradually to have established
a complete ascendancy over the mind,
first of his uncle, and ultimately of all his
followers; and to have used his influence in
a manner which indicates most enlarged public
spirit, and a great mixture, at least, of political
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears, that during the various tumults
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>which took place during the early periods of
the Reformation, several persons in England,
and some in Germany, (the parties holding
communication through the means of Müller
and his connexions in both countries,) meditated
a removal to some distant region, in
which they should escape finally from strife
and oppression, and establish a civil and religious
community on such principles as they
were fondly cherishing. After the proposal
and rejection of various schemes, and after
many delays and disappointments, the projected
departure in search of a new settlement
took place, under the guidance of their enthusiastic
and adventurous leader. Instead of
proceeding to America, as had been originally
proposed, they were induced by some glowing
descriptions they had heard, but which proved
to consist chiefly of fable or exaggeration, to
seek for the long-famed southern continent, the
“Terra Australis Incognita.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The curious and interesting particulars of
their voyage, their various adventures, disappointments,
and reiterated attempts, we are
compelled to pass over. The result was their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>being ultimately driven by a storm on the coast
of New Holland, somewhere, it is supposed,
between lat. 10 and 20 south, and lon. 130
and 140 east, where one out of the four ships
was wrecked on a coral reef, and two of the
others driven ashore with considerable damage.
They saved, however, not only their lives, but
nearly all their property, including the live
stock with which they had provided themselves;
and it appears that their first idea was
to repair their vessels, and proceed along the
coast, in an endeavour to find a suitable spot
for a settlement; the part on which they were
cast being not only barren and uninviting but
excessively marshy. This last circumstance
compelled them to forego their design; for a
fever broke out, and affected so many of them
that they lost no time in removing to a healthier
situation, eight or nine miles from the coast.
Here the sick speedily recovered; and, as the
spot seemed highly salubrious, though for the
most part barren, with only a small proportion
of land fit for cultivation near the banks of
small rivers, they proceeded to build log-houses
and cultivate the land; designing to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>their settlement either temporary or permanent,
as circumstances might determine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their decision was ultimately fixed by means
of the intercourse they succeeded in establishing
with a native tribe. Mutual good-will and
confidence having been completely established
between the settlers and the natives (chiefly, as
it should seem, through the judicious exertions
of the younger Müller),—and an increasing
knowledge of each other’s language having
established a free communication between the
parties,—the settlers were interested by the
glowing colours in which their new friends described
a region in the interior, which they—that
is, some of the very individuals who spoke
of it, and the ancestors of the rest,—had formerly
inhabited, and from which successive
portions of their tribe had been from time to
time expelled by more powerful hostile tribes.
They were anxious to induce their European
neighbours to settle there themselves, and enable
them to reinstate themselves in their ancient
abode. They easily perceived the vast
superiority which European arts and arms
would give to their new allies over enemies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>who had proved too powerful for themselves,
and they hoped through their aid to re-establish
themselves in a country which they had
quitted with regret.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moved by their representations, the settlers
despatched two active young men, in company
with some native guides, to explore this highly-vaunted
region; they proceeded accordingly,
nearly in a direct line from the coast, to a
range of mountains, about ninety or a hundred
miles in the interior, which they surmounted,
not without difficulty, and then found themselves
in an elevated plain of a most sterile
character, extending for more than a hundred
miles in the same direction: this they traversed
with some difficulty, and arrived at another
chain of rocky mountains, forming a still more
formidable barrier, which they would have had
great difficulty in surmounting but for the local
knowledge of their guides.</p>

<p class='c011'>On passing this, however, they were rewarded
by the view of a most extensive and delightfully
fertile region, watered with numerous
streams from these mountains, and interspersed
with beautiful lakes. The whole appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the country fully justified the descriptions
given; and the accounts of these first explorers
were so favourable that a second expedition
was undertaken, with a view to a more complete
examination of the country, by young
Müller himself and four others, who passed a
considerable time in exploring the district, not
without some narrow escapes from the hostility
of some of the wandering native tribes; and
the result of their examination was so favourable,
that the settlers were induced to come to
the resolution of finally removing the colony to
the interior.</p>

<p class='c011'>This, after due preparation, they accomplished,
moving in two separate divisions; the first
consisting of the greater part of the most active
of the adult males, both of the Europeans and
their native allies, who were to prepare habitations,
and break up land for tillage, &#38;c. ready
to receive the rest after an interval of some
months. The entire removal was completed in
the course of the third year from their first
arrival on the coast. Their numbers appear to
have been between three and four hundred, in
all, of white people, besides a somewhat smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>number of natives; the country in which they
had first settled admitting of only a small and
scattered population, of tribes subsisting by the
chase.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very soon after taking possession of their
new abode they were attacked, in spite of all
their endeavours to preserve peace, by the
native tribes of the interior, moved by their
inveterate animosity against their ancient enemies:
the settlers, however, gained an easy
and complete victory in every encounter; their
fire-arms, though only the old-fashioned, clumsy
matchlocks of those days, being sufficient to
strike terror into savages unacquainted with
gunpowder; though, independent of their
guns, their bows would have given them a
decided superiority. It is well known how
skilful and how formidable were the English
archers of those days; and they could annoy
the natives, among whom the bow is unknown,
at three times the distance to which these could
throw their spears. The native allies also, having
been taught by the Europeans to use the bow,
which, even in their less skilful hands, had an
advantage over the spear,—and being also furnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>with cutlasses, hatchets, and steel heads
to their pikes,—now proved greatly an overmatch
for their former conquerors, who had
only wooden swords and bone-headed spears.</p>

<p class='c011'>A peace ensued, which, however, was for
several years interrupted from time to time by
predatory incursions and irregular renewals of
hostilities. This state of things, with all its
inconveniences, appears to have had the advantage
of cementing the friendship between
the settlers and their native allies; each party
feeling the other’s importance for security
against a common enemy. The whites, accordingly,
seem to have been assiduous and
successful in civilizing these natives, with
whom they were thus thrown into close contact.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ultimately, the colony was delivered from
all danger from the hostile tribes by an event
which threatened disaster. A formidable combination
was secretly formed among all the
tribes for a considerable distance round, for the
purpose of making a united attack, by surprise,
with all their forces. It was so far successful
that a band, far outnumbering all that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>settlers could muster, unexpectedly attacking
one of their villages, obliged the inhabitants to
fly in the utmost haste, and spread the alarm
through the whole colony. This success, however,
proved their ruin; for, with the genuine
improvidence of savages, instead of rapidly
pushing forward their forces, they eagerly fell
to plundering the various stores, especially of
provisions, which had been abandoned; and,
as an army of savages is never well provided
with a commissariat, gladly betook themselves
to feasting on what they found.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among other things, was a large supply of
beer; for the settlers had brought with them,
and successfully practised, the art of brewing,
with which they had been familiar at home.
Wine they had not as yet attained to, though
they had begun the cultivation of the vine, as
well as of several other European fruit-trees.
The savages indulged in the liquor with characteristic
excess; and, while they were lost in
intoxication, set fire, either accidentally or intentionally,
to the wooden houses and stacks
with which they were surrounded. The fire
raged fiercely in all directions; and most of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the men were too much stupified with liquor
to escape the flames, and were either stifled or
burnt; a considerable number, however, were
rescued by the settlers, who had by this time
come together, and who at once saved and took
prisoners most of the survivors, who were
too helplessly drunk for either resistance or
flight.</p>

<p class='c011'>This event, which at once and for ever
broke the power of their enemies, has been ever
since annually commemorated in the colony; a
day of solemn thanksgiving being concluded by
the lighting of large bonfires in the evening, by
parties who pass round among themselves a
spear, such as the natives use, and a cup of
beer, of which each tastes, in memory of their
deliverance. This festival which the Müllers
instituted, accompanying the celebration with
apposite reflections on drunkenness and its
effects, has probably tended, along with other
circumstances, to keep up an almost universal
habit of sobriety throughout the colony.</p>

<p class='c011'>This interesting portion of their early history,
thus impressed on their minds and familiarized
to their thoughts from childhood, creates an indelible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>association of the idea of drunkenness, not
only with those of helplessness and disaster, but
also with that of the character of brutish and
stupid <i>savages</i>. Indeed, in several other points
also, our travellers found the idea of <i>savage</i> life
so associated with some others in the minds of
these people, as to influence considerably their
conduct and habits of thought. They have a
deep-seated and habitual contempt for every
thing which, according to their notions, savours
of barbarism; and this shows itself in many
points, which to a modern European would
be likely to appear whimsical. The younger
Müller, though indefatigable in his kindness towards
the native tribes, appears to have cherished
this feeling in his own people. He laboured
strenuously to reclaim and civilize the
savages, and was equally anxious to guard
against the reverse process—the approximation
of the white men towards the habits of the
savages: and, as he seems to have been a very
able though eccentric man, and possessed boundless
influence over the colonists, who were
under his government for above half a century,
he succeeded in effectually stamping his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>character on the nation, and perpetuating his
institutions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hostile tribes, after the above event,
surrendered at discretion; and they consented
(those of them who had a considerable proportion
of able-bodied men remaining alive) to remove
beyond a certain specified boundary, far
beyond the then limits of the colony; but several
tribes, which now consisted almost entirely
of women and children, and were consequently
hardly capable of providing for themselves,
were, at their own entreaty, received as subjects,
and incorporated, along with the previously-allied
natives, into the body of the
settlers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The European and aboriginal races became
in time completely blended together; for it appears
to have been one of the principles most
earnestly maintained and inculcated by their
extraordinary leader, to allow of no hereditary
degradation; no subjection of one race of men
to another on the ground of colour or caste,
but to make all subjects of the state necessarily
admissible to the rights of citizenship. Yet, on
the other hand, he was well aware of the actual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>inferiority of the aborigines as individuals and
as a race, and was fully alive to the evil of
placing inferior men on a level with those
morally and intellectually superior. The maxim,
accordingly, which he continually dwelt
on, and laboured to embody in practice, was,
that it is not the colour of the skin, but the
heart and head, that makes a man savage or
civilized. Education, accordingly, was the
means adopted for reclaiming and for preserving
men from barbarism: and examinations, to
ascertain how far each had profited by the education
bestowed, were made the test for admissibility
into the highest public stations.</p>

<p class='c011'>This principle has been in great measure
adhered to in the several states into which the
settlement was afterwards divided, though differing
from each other in many respects in
their forms of government. And yet, as Müller
used himself to observe, one man may be much
superior in fitness for certain public offices to
another, who may be far beyond him in proficiency
in a prescribed course of studies, and
in everything that can be ascertained in any
regular examination; but then, he used to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>add, when you come to a greater number, one
hundred men well taught will always be superior
to a hundred untaught, and fitter to govern
the community. In all the states, accordingly,
their senates are always required to consist
of men who have given proof of their
proficiency in a prescribed course of study;
but these are left free to choose, and sometimes
do choose, for the discharge of important offices,
men who are inferior in this respect, but qualified
by natural sagacity and practical habits
of business.</p>

<p class='c009'>Increase of the Settlement.—Separation of the States.—Ecclesiastical
Communities.—Concord among Sects.—Houses and
Towns.—Penal Colonies.—Southlanders’ Hospitality.—Mode
of receiving Company.—Feasts.—Animal Food.—Tame Animals.—Surprise
at English Customs.—Carnivorous Propensity.—Lighting
the Streets.—City of Bath.</p>

<p class='c010'>The settlement, on being thus (about five or
six years from its commencement) freed from
all external molestation, increased in prosperity,
and extended itself rapidly in several directions
inland. Towards the sea they had no temptation
to advance; being separated from it by an
extensive district of great sterility, and of difficult
passage. Inward, the abundance of fertile land,
and the numerous lakes with which our travellers
had been struck, and which afforded easy
intercourse even between settlements at a considerable
distance, invited them to overspread
the country as fast as their rapidly-increasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>population required. Their numbers seem to
have advanced at about the same rate as those
of some of the North-American settlements.</p>

<p class='c011'>The division into separate states was not, as
the travellers found to their surprise, the result
of discord, but had been planned and commenced
by their founder himself. He had, it seems,
foreseen, or fancied that he foresaw, an ultimate
necessity for such a separation; and he judged
it best that it should begin even in his own lifetime,
before there was any advantage in it,
except that of setting an example and establishing
a precedent for amicable separation. He
founded, accordingly, within forty years from
their first settling, a second perfectly independent
community, on the opposite side of the
lake, near which the first had been located.
The original settlement still forms one of the
states, and retains the name of Müllersfield,
which it received from the founders: the new
one, from its singular beauty of situation, he
called Eutopia (fine place), probably with something
of a covert allusion also to the well-known
fabulous Utopia (no place). The most perfect
friendliness and freedom of intercourse continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>between the two states; and, without
owning any common authority, they consulted
together, like any two individual neighbours
who are on friendly terms, respecting any matters
in which they had a common concern: and
the principles of the procedure having been
clearly laid down, and practically established,
the example was afterwards repeatedly followed
as the colonization extended itself; and
fresh swarms, as it were, issued forth, till the
number of the separate states amounted to
eleven.</p>

<p class='c011'>A similar principle has been acted on with
respect to ecclesiastical communities. The
number of separate churches amounts to no
less than seventeen; though some of these consist
chiefly of converted native tribes, together
with the missionaries residing among them.
These churches are, of course, not coextensive
with the several states, but on the footing of the
early churches founded by the apostles, who instituted
several distinct ones,—for instance, in
the single province of Macedonia; viz. those of
Philippi, Thessalonica, Berœa, &#38;c. They are all,
and have ever been, with a few temporary exceptions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>in concord and communion with each
other, but under distinct governments, and differing
in some non-essential customs and institutions.
They seem to have made good a favourite
maxim of Müller’s on that subject;—that
men are always most likely to live in
friendly agreement in essentials, when they are
not so closely connected as to be obliged to
agree in matters intrinsically indifferent. “Two
men,” he used to observe, “who may be very
friendly as neighbours, might quarrel, if they
were obliged to live together, as to the hour at
which they should dine,—the keeping of the
windows open or shut, &#38;c.;—in which one
party would necessarily be compelled to give
way to the other: whereas they may be very
good friends while each follows his own taste
in such matters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We shall subjoin such scattered extracts as
our space will admit, of those portions of our
travellers’ Journal which illustrate the more
strange and singular particulars of the habits
of this interesting people.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Nearly all their houses—in the towns, all,
without exception—are flat-roofed, like those
in the East; whether from a fancy of imitating
the custom they read of in Scripture, or for the
convenience of having an airy unconfined place
to walk or sit on. In the towns, there is, as in
those of the East, a thoroughfare for foot-passengers
along the tops of the houses; and, in
the larger towns, the streets are crossed occasionally
by light bridges.</p>

<p class='c011'>The houses in the towns, and all but the
meaner sort of cottages in the newly-settled
part of the country, are without any chimneys
opening to the air: the smoke from the fireplaces
of one or two, or more, adjoining houses,
passes into a sort of chamber (swept from time
to time), from which it is forced out by machinery
into a flue branching off into pipes,
which carry it back to the bottom of each fire;
so that it burns its own smoke. When the visitors
were describing to some Eutopians the
European towns, these people remarked that
London, for instance, though so much improved
since the times of which they had historical
records from their ancestors, must still have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>a very smoky atmosphere; and that, to walk
along the streets, shut in by houses on both
sides, must be very unpleasant, for want of
open prospect and free circulation of air.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>It was with much difficulty that these people
were brought to understand the nature of the
colony from which their visitors came; not that
they were in general dull of apprehension, but
they could scarcely satisfy themselves that they
had rightly understood the accounts given
them. To people a new settlement with convicted
criminals,—to form a new nation of the
scum and refuse of mankind,—appeared to
them so preposterous, that for some time they
could not help supposing they must have misunderstood
their informants. “To bring together
a number of villains,” they said, “to a
country where good character is not the rule,
but the exception, allowing them free intercourse
with each other must be the most effectual
mode of hardening and confirming them in
wickedness, and entailing the same character
on successive generations:” and though it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>explained to them that one great object of
the plan was to reform the criminals, the accounts
which truth constrained their visitors to
give of the actual state of morals in the colony
did not seem to satisfy them. They had wondered
at first, they said, that such a scheme
should have been originally thought of, and
now they wondered still more that it should be
persevered in.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>The travellers were entertained with the
kindest and most liberal hospitality, according
to the notions of the Southlanders (such is the
general name by which the inhabitants of all
the states distinguish themselves from their
European ancestors and other Europeans); but
their hospitality differs considerably from ours.
When residing as guests with any family, they
partook of the family meals; but when invited
to a party, as they frequently were, to meet the
principal gentry of the neighbourhood,—who
were anxious both to show attention to the
strangers and to gratify their own curiosity,—it
was found that there is no such thing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>this country as what we call a dinner-party;
that is, the company did not sit down together
to a regular meal, but partook of refreshments
something more of the character of an English
luncheon, which was provided in all the superior
houses in a separate room. The guests
dropped into this eating-room irregularly, and
seating themselves in small promiscuous parties
at small tables set out there, were served by
the attendants with the various dishes provided.
They stayed as long as they pleased;
conversed occasionally with their neighbours,
as we do at an irregular luncheon, and returned
to the “company-room” (as it is called),
without ceremony, whenever they chose. No
refreshments were brought into this last, except
such as correspond to what we have at
evening parties,—such as cakes, lemonade,
wine and water, ices (in those districts which
are near the mountains), dried or fresh fruits,
&#38;c.: this they consider as what they call the
most “honourable”—what we should call
“stylish”—mode of receiving company.</p>

<p class='c011'>When our habits were described to them,
they expressed their wonder that a civilized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>people should <i>make feasts as the savages do</i>.
“The half-reclaimed native tribes,” they said,
“invite their friends whom they wish to honour
to a solemn feast, at which, having provided
a large quantity of their best provisions
and liquor, and exerted what skill they have in
cookery, the guests all seat themselves, with
sundry formalities, round the food that is dressed,
and regale themselves altogether; but with
the Southlanders such an arrangement as this
is only adopted as a convenience, when there is
a large number of persons to be fed in the least
troublesome way.” They accordingly promised,
laughingly, to take their visitors to something
like an English dinner-party; and the party to
which they invited them (it was during the
season of hay harvest) consisted of about two
dozen mowers, with several of their wives and
children, seated round a long table, with the
master at the head of it, and supping on an
ample supply of substantial food, served up
in five or six huge dishes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cookery among the higher classes is for
the most part plain and simple, and the few
who have refined much upon the luxuries of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the table are exposed to something of the same
sort of contemptuous ridicule that the being
called a dandy incurs among us. But a circumstance
which early attracted the attention
of the visitors was, that they found the animal
food to consist (besides eggs, cheese, and various
preparations of milk) entirely of fish and
game. The pork, which they often met with,
they found to be always the flesh of the wild
swine: these were derived from those brought
over by the first settlers, who turned them all
loose into the woods; and the chase of the
wild-boar is eagerly pursued by many of the
gentry. Wild cattle are also met with in some
parts, descended from such as had accidentally
strayed; and the flesh of these is eaten, as well
as that of the kangaroo, emu, and other indigenous
animals: but the visitors one day, in
the course of conversation in the eating-room,
expressed their surprise at having never seen
any mutton served up, though sheep were not
uncommon. The Southlanders had never heard
the word mutton; but, when it was explained
to them that it meant the flesh of the sheep,
they replied, “That they kept their sheep very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>carefully for their wool, and that there were no
wild sheep in the country: but when it was
explained to them that we kept both sheep and
oxen chiefly for the purpose of feeding on their
flesh, they were both astonished and disgusted
that we should have retained such a <i>barbarian</i>
custom (for they regard themselves as many
degrees more civilized than their European
ancestors) as that of killing and eating domestic
animals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was urged (and they freely admitted it)
that the loss of life is no greater to a tame than
to a wild animal: “That is true,” they said, “as
far as the <i>animal</i> is concerned; but it makes a
great difference to <i>our</i> feelings. A tame animal
is a sort of friend, a member of the family:
it seems a sort of treacherous breach of hospitality
to kill in cold blood a creature which
you have reared and fed from its birth, and
then devour its flesh.” They expressed still
more surprise (for they are keen sportsmen) at
learning that some Europeans were vehement in
their censures of hunting, fowling, and fishing,
as cruel; and yet fed without scruple on beef
and mutton. “We declare war,” they said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>laughing, “perhaps an unjust war, against wild
animals, and kill them as enemies; but you assassinate
your friends.”—“We urged,” says the
journalist, “the necessity of keeping within
bounds the numbers of our domestic animals;
and expressed our apprehension that the Southlanders
would in time find themselves quite
overstocked with sheep, oxen, and fowls.”
They replied at the moment, merely, “that
no such apprehension had ever occurred to
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, on returning to what we should call the
drawing-room, we soon found that much interest
was excited by the accounts of what
appeared to this most singular people our
strange custom. We were surrounded by ladies,
who inquired, with an amusing mixture
of good-humoured ridicule, wonder, and horror,
into all the particulars respecting mutton; and
one lady surprised us by asking, among other
things, what kind of flesh was that of horses,
dogs, and cats, and by what name we called it.
When informed that, though we kept these
animals, we never thought of eating them, she
replied, “Why, I had understood that you ate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the <i>flesh of domestic animals</i>, and that you
found it <i>necessary</i> to do so, for fear of their
<i>overstocking you with their numbers</i>! How
comes it that you are not overrun with horses,
dogs, and cats?” To say the truth, we
were rather dumbfounded by this question;
having, in fact, assigned as a reason what we
had been accustomed to hear and repeat without
any examination into its soundness. We
could only allege that, in all these points, we
conformed to what had always been the practice
of our ancestors and theirs, and of almost
all other nations: in this we were borne out
by the testimony of those of the company who
were well read in antiquities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several of these people, indeed, are good
scholars, and well acquainted with the history
(as far as was known three hundred years ago)
of other nations, besides their own. They adverted
to the descriptions of Homer’s heroes:
one of them would, when about to entertain
his friends, have a sheep brought into his tent,
cut its throat with his own royal hands, and
then, with a skilful hand,—which the poet
never fails to celebrate,—cut it up into slices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and broil them on skewers over a charcoal fire.
They remembered, also, the accounts given of
some East-Indian tribes, who, when their relatives
are grown old and infirm, kill them, to
save them from lingering decay, and hold a
pious and solemn feast on their flesh. But
as these customs had worn away in the early
progress of civilization, they wondered that a
still further refinement had not, among us, confined
the carnivorous propensity of man to wild
animals exclusively, and led us, as it had them,
to regard with disgust the eating of (as they
expressed it) one of the family, whose eggs,
milk, labour, or wool had long ministered to
our comforts.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>The description of our cities in their present
condition, as contrasted with that of the sixteenth
century, and of our whole mode of
life, was exceedingly interesting to these people;
but nothing did they admire more than
our description of the gas-lights. In the midst,
however, of their enquiries and admiration,
one sly-looking old gentleman observed, “that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>if we would honour him with a visit in his
city of Bath (capital of a state of the same
name), he would excite even our admiration
by the spectacle of an illumination still more
splendid.” In our visit there, where we were
most kindly received, our host walked through
the streets with us, showing us the principal
buildings, and introduced us into the Senate-house,
where the public business was going on.</p>

<p class='c011'>On our return to his house, he asked us (this
was about seven o’clock in the morning) what
we thought of the lighting of the streets. We
answered, that we observed neither any lighting
of them, nor need of it, as it was a bright
sunshine. “And is not this,” said he, “as good
a light as your gas? We have not,” he added,
“gone so far as you in arts; but we have the
advantage of you in availing ourselves of the
gifts of nature; for, as you must have observed,
we are all alert and about our business at
day-break; while you, by your own account,
allow three or four hours of daylight in the
spring and summer to be utterly wasted, while
you are abed; and then go about your business
at night, like owls and bats, but without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>their advantage of being able to see in the
dark; so that you are forced to light yourselves
with gas. It was,” said he, “a very ingenious
contrivance you were telling us of
t’other day, by which you distil fresh water
from the sea; but pray do you, when there
are plenty of fresh springs, let all the water
run to waste, that you may have the triumph
of distilling from the brine?”</p>

<p class='c011'>We endeavoured to explain to him the causes
of our late hours; but we were astounded
when he had made us compute the saving in
oil, and gas, and tallow, which might be effected
by a general resolution to <i>use daylight as far
as it would go</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The city at which this conversation took
place is named from its celebrated warm baths,
supplied by springs issuing from a mountain in
the vicinity; one of the greatest curiosities in
the country, both from the natural phenomena
it exhibits (being evidently an extinct volcano),
from which it received its name of Mount
Peril, and from the extraordinary tradition
of the superstitious ordeal formerly connected
with it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Duels.—Judicial Combats.—Existing Code of Honour.—Appeal
to Arms.—Discussion on Duelling.—Mount Peril.—Noxious
Vapours.—The Cavern.</p>

<p class='c010'>The visit of the travellers to Mount Peril, in
the state of Bath, was preceded, and in some
measure probably caused, by a conversation casually
occurring on the subject of duels; and
the notes taken of this, it may be as well first
to lay before the reader.</p>

<p class='c011'>Much inquiry and mutual communication
appear to have taken place, as was to be expected,
between the Southlanders and their
guests respecting the institutions and manners
of their respective countries; and among others
the subject of duelling, as prevailing among
the Europeans and Americans, happened one
day to be introduced in a mixed company. A
large proportion of the younger persons present
expressed their astonishment that a people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>pretending to civilization should fight out their
disputes “like the savages.” This expression,
as appears from several of the notices already
recorded, was perpetually in their mouths; and
some added, that the savages in their code of
honour had the advantage of the Europeans.
The New-Hollanders in these parts have, it
seems, in respect of their duels, similar customs
to those that have been observed by our settlers.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has long been known that the aborigines
of New South Wales leave all quarrels between
individuals to be settled by a solemn judicial
combat, the community interfering no farther
than to see fair play. But their notions of fair
play differ considerably from ours. If it, indeed,
does not appear clearly which is the party
aggrieved, they fight it out, man to man; the
tribe being present as bystanders, while the
combatants engage with spears or waddies
(wooden swords) till the <i>satisfaction</i> is complete.
But if one of the parties is adjudged
to have the preponderance of justice on his
side, he is allowed to bring a friend with him,
as an auxiliary; and in very flagrant cases,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>even two or more, according to the character of
the offence to be avenged.</p>

<p class='c011'>In all cases, the offending party, however
clear his guilt may be, is allowed to fight for
his life; but in some cases, of course, against
such odds as render it next to impossible he
should escape. This, the Southlanders observed,
was a degree better than the European
duels, in which the regulations of our code of
honour require the parties, however palpably
one of them may be in the wrong, to meet
on equal terms, or with an inequality only in
favour of the one who may chance to be the
better shot or swordsman.</p>

<p class='c011'>Others of the company entered more fully
into the discussion of the general grounds on
which duelling is to be reprobated, being cordially
joined in their censure by Mr. Jones, who
urged the objections, with which every one is
familiar, against the wickedness of taking away
a fellow-creature’s life, and exposing one’s own,
in revenge for a trifling affront—the absurdity
of calling it a satisfaction to stand to be shot
at, and other such topics, which it is unnecessary
to enlarge on, as they may be read in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>numerous essays and tales, and heard at every
tea-table.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Messrs. Smith, on the other hand (naval
men, as has been already mentioned) took the
other side, and endeavoured to vindicate the
existing code of honour. They urged that it is
needless and nugatory to go about to prove
that a duel is a bad thing, and that to censure
the laws of honour on that ground is as unfair
as to censure the law of the land on the ground
that imprisonment and hanging are evils, these
being the penalties denounced against a violation
of the laws.</p>

<p class='c011'>The requisition to expose one’s life in a duel
is, in like manner, the penalty denounced
against a violation of the rules established in
the society of gentlemen. The law of honour,
they said, does not enjoin men to seek a duel
as a desirable thing, but, on the contrary, to
act in such a manner as to preclude all occasion
for an appeal to arms; and that the penalty
which any system of rules holds out against the
violation of them should be regarded as something
to be carefully avoided: this, so far from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>being an objection to the system, is essential to
its maintenance. As for the unfairness of putting
the injured and injuring party on a level,
<i>that</i> they did not deny; but contended that
it was an unavoidable evil, as in the case of
war between two independent states. That
every war is an evil,—that in every war one
party must be in the wrong, and very often
both: all this is universally admitted, but all
this does not answer the practical question,
whether, on the ground that war is an evil,
a state should submit, and proclaim itself ready
to submit, to any extent of encroachment and
aggression from foreign nations without resistance.
“If you go to war,” it might be urged,
“with those who have wronged you, you put
yourself on equal terms with the wrong-doer,
and are likely to suffer as much or more than
the offending party.” “Very true,” it might
be answered, “but we cannot help that; if we
could, we would make all the evil of the war
fall on the nation that has injured us; but as it
is, we must do the best we can to deter our
neighbours from injuring us: having no common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>superior to appeal to, we have no alternative
but to fight for our rights, or to be
insulted and oppressed with impunity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When it was urged in reply, that, though
nations have not, individuals have, a common
authority to appeal to—that of the community
to which they belong, this was roundly denied;
and it was contended that the appeal
to single combat does not take place in cases
when the law of the land provides adequate
redress, but in those only where it either cannot
or will not afford any, or any but such
as would be a mere mockery to the feelings
of the sufferer. A man, they urge, does not
challenge any one for robbing him of his purse,
or for firing his barn, but for injuries of quite a
different description, far more grievous to one
moving in a certain circle of society, but which
the law either refuses to take cognizance of at
all, or for which it provides such redress as
would aggravate the evil by rendering the
sufferer ridiculous. Now a man resigns to
the community his natural right of personal
self-defence on the implied condition that the
community shall protect him; and in cases,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>therefore, where it either cannot, or will not,
fulfil this condition, his original natural right
remains unimpaired. Thus, when a man is
suddenly assaulted by a robber, he is free to
defend his person and property as well as he
can; and on the same principle, when the
injury is of such a character as the law will
not, or cannot, defend him from, he is left to
guard his own honour with his own hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the evils resulting from duels, they
observed that it is most unfair not to take
into account—though to calculate would be
impossible—the immense amount of evils prevented,
and which there is reason to suppose
would take place but for the apprehension of
a duel. The insolence, the falsehood, the slander,
the base and the overbearing conduct,
which are daily kept in check in many thousands
of persons by the recollection that there
is such a thing as being “called out” for such
behaviour, is what no one can compute with
any approach to accuracy; these being preventive
and negative effects, and therefore incapable
of being calculated, and liable to be
underrated.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Some idea, however, they added, may be
formed of these effects of the laws of honour
by looking to the conduct of those classes of
persons who are exempted from them. The
ancient Greeks and Romans, for instance, who
are cried up as exempt from this Gothic barbarism,
were accustomed, as we see from the
specimens of their orators that have come
down to us, publicly to revile each other in
the grossest language. The Mahometans also,
of all ranks, appear to be, with few exceptions,
very much what Europeans would characterize
by the term “blackguards;” and the same description
seems very applicable to the people of
the Celestial empire, from the haughty mandarin
downwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Europe, again, said these gentlemen, we
see that those among the higher classes—viz.
ladies and clergymen, (it is to be presumed the
Messrs. Smith had met with unfavourable specimens
of these, and were rashly judging from
such specimens,)—who are exempt from this
law, are apt to avail themselves of that exemption
by indulging themselves in the use
of such language, and in such violation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>truth and of decorum in their attacks on opponents
as a layman would be deterred from
by the apprehension of personal danger; so
that, on the whole, it was contended that the
evil of the lives lost in duels—an extremely
small number—may be reckoned a cheap price
paid by society for the advantages of civilized
and well-regulated manners. And, after all, it
was added, even that evil is not to be laid
to the charge of the law of honour as a necessary
accompaniment, since, if all persons adhered
constantly to the rules of good society,
there would never be occasion for a duel; in
the same manner as there would never be occasion,
if all men would comply with the law of
the land, for any of the penalties of the law
to be actually inflicted.</p>

<p class='c011'>An old gentleman named Christopher Adamson,
of the State of Bath, who was present at
this discussion, now came forward to declare
his conviction that these arguments, though
not without plausibility, were entirely unsound,
and his confidence that he should be able to
establish this to the satisfaction of the whole
party; but he proposed to defer giving his reasons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>till they should have viewed a spot in his
neighbourhood, curious and interesting on many
accounts, and closely and historically connected
with the subject under discussion.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the celebrated Mount Peril (already
alluded to), in the immediate vicinity of the
city of Bath. The invitation was accepted;
and the travellers shortly after set out on their
excursion to visit this mountain. It plainly
appears to be an extinct volcano. The settlers
found it regarded with superstitious awe by the
natives, who had among them a tradition of
smoke having been seen at times to issue from
it, and who regarded it as the habitation of
certain malignant deities, of a similar character
to the Pèlè venerated in the island of Hawaii
(Owhyhee). The medicinal warm springs flowing
from the foot of it gave occasion to the
fixing of the city of Bath (thence so named) in
the neighbourhood. It is one of the oldest
states, the warm baths having early acquired
such repute as to be highly attractive.</p>

<p class='c011'>The circumstance which gave rise to the appellation
of Mount Peril was the existence of
certain caverns and fissures on one of its sides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>emitting at times noxious vapours, which had
more than once proved fatal to those who had
incautiously ventured too near them. These
were reputed by the natives to be the abode of
evil spirits, destructive to such as approached
them: and in the etymological sense of the
word spirit (<i>spiritus</i>, blast) this might be said
to be literally true; for our travellers soon
ascertained that the danger arose from a deleterious
gas, the same that in coalpits is called
the choke-damp, found also in the celebrated
“Grotto del Cane” in Italy, named and long
celebrated for the cruel experiments practised
on dogs for the gratification of travellers. This
gas, now well known to every smatterer in
chemistry as the carbonic acid gas, so poisonous
when received into the lungs, issues forth,
it should seem, in irregular blasts from these
caverns, so as to render them more dangerous
of approach at some times than at others; so
that many persons have passed with impunity
spots which have at different times affected
others with alarming or even fatal suffocation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cavern which the travellers inspected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the most closely is situated at the foot of a perpendicular
cliff, about fifty feet in height, from
the top of which the mouth may be seen very
distinctly and with perfect safety; the gas being,
as is well known, so much heavier than
common air that there is no danger of its rising
even near so high as the top of the cliff. The
visitors tried the experiment of letting down
by a rope, with a chain at the lower end of
it, a little iron grating brought for the purpose,
containing (as a humane substitute for a living
dog) splinters of dry wood set on fire, which
being lowered when in a full blaze into the
cavern’s mouth, were suddenly and completely
extinguished. This cavern was easily accessible
from below, as it opened a kind of terrace
of nearly level ground, called “the Ordeal
Path;” but though many persons had passed
it with impunity, it was considered too hazardous
an experiment to be wantonly risked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Adamson afterwards proceeded to relate
the circumstances connected with the cavern.
Many superstitious notions, it seems, and much
tendency to give credit to tales of supernatural
mystery had been brought from Europe by
several of the original settlers, trained as they
had been in the then prevailing credulity, and
many of them tinctured with fanaticism. It is
not to be wondered therefore, that, ignorant as
they were of physical phenomena, several should
have given more or less credit to the reports of
the natives respecting evil demons dwelling in
these caverns; the dangerous nature of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>having been proved in some instances by fatal
experience.</p>

<p class='c011'>The employment of one of them for the purpose
of an ordeal originated long after. “It
ought in the first place to be acknowledged,”
said Mr. Adamson, “that the barbarian institution
of duels did exist among us, though now
long since exploded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were not of common occurrence; but
he added that his father distinctly remembered
as a boy the final abolition of the practice,
in the manner about to be related. The duel
was regarded—and such is well known to
have been its original design—as a kind of
ordeal, as a solemn appeal to Heaven, which it
was supposed would not fail to interfere in
support of the rightful combatant.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here Mr. Sibthorpe had the candour
to interpose a remark, that, though <i>duels</i> have
long since ceased to be considered in that light,
the general principle is very far from being
exploded among a large proportion of our own
countrymen, who frequently apply the terms
“providential,” and even “miraculous,” to the
detection of murderers; the frustration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>schemes of injustice; the escape of pious men
from dangers of shipwreck or fire, &#38;c. and who
speak of pestilential diseases, conflagrations,
and other fatal accidents, as judgments from
Heaven on the sufferers; evidently referring to
a supposed special interference of Providence
to allot temporal successes or adversities according
to the deserts of the parties; and often
setting down as little better than an atheist
any one who questions such a doctrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now,” said he, “if it be admitted that there
is a special and extraordinary interference of
Providence for the immediate temporal punishment
of the wicked, and for the securing of success
to a righteous cause, there seems no reason
why this should not be looked for in the case of
a judicial combat. Our ancestors were at least
as wise as we, and more consistent, if we
deride or reprobate the idea of a special interposition
of Providence in the case of a single
combat, while we look for it in all <i>other</i> cases.
And you well know,” added he to Mr. Jones,
“how strongly the doctrine I allude to is set
forth in newspapers—in magazines—in publications
of various descriptions, and, not least,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in the nursery-books which are first put into
the hands of children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This could not be denied. “Well, such,”
continued Mr. Adamson, “had been our belief
as well as yours. But while the trial by single
combat was retained under an altered character,
the other kinds of ordeal—such as the hot
ploughshare, &#38;c. to which women, as well as
men, had in former times been exposed—fell
completely into desuetude.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the Southlanders the institution was,
by an accidental circumstance, reintroduced.
It seems that a woman, named Margaret
Brucker, had been grossly defamed by a neighbour,
and being highly indignant at the imputations
cast on her virtue, and conscious of
perfect innocence, she appealed to the judgment
of Heaven, and challenged her accuser to accompany
her publicly along the mountain side,
by what was afterwards called the ‘Ordeal
Path,’ to pass by the goblin cavern, the one
viewed by our travellers. She professed her
full confidence that her innocence would protect
her from the demons residing there, and
that the false accusation would be visited by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>a divine judgment on her who had devised
it. Margaret appears to have been a perfectly
sincere enthusiast, and to have possessed that
fervid eloquence which is the result of genuine
strong feeling. This, together with youth,
beauty, and the sympathy excited by her distress
of mind, operated so strongly on the superstitious
feelings of the people that they
vehemently seconded her proposal; and the
woman who had accused her dared not refuse
the trial.</p>

<p class='c011'>The parties accordingly set forth, attended
by a great concourse of eager spectators, who
ranged themselves on the edge of the cliff overhanging
the cavern in breathless expectation
of the results. The magistrates had only ventured
to exert their authority so far as to require
that ropes should be let down from the
top of the cliff, and secured by straps to the
body of each of the women, so that in case
of danger they might be safely drawn up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Margaret, with a firm and undaunted step,
walked unhurt close along the mouth of the
cavern. Her companion, who had been observed
to become pale and agitated as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>approached the scene of trial, sank down insensible
at the entrance of the cavern. The
mingled shouts of wonder, alarm, horror, and
exultation proceeding from the spectators of
this complete fulfilment of the prophecy may
easily be imagined. The fainting victim was
drawn up by the rope to the top of the cliff, to
all appearance dead. By sprinkling her with
water, however, she gradually revived; and
on being restored to her senses and speech,
confessed, with much awe and contrition, the
entire falsity of the stories she had circulated,
and which she had fabricated through jealousy.
She acknowledged, and no doubt fully believed,
that she had been struck down by the demon
of the goblin cavern as a just judgment on
her calumny. Of course Margaret Brucker
was venerated as little less than a prophetess,
and the ordeal rose into high and general
repute.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several, indeed, of the more sagacious entertained
at the time the opinion which it would
then have been most discreditable to avow, but
which has long since become universal, that the
one party escaped unhurt because she walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>erect across the opening of the cavern, the
noxious gas being so heavy that its influence
does not usually extend much more than one
or two feet above the surface of the ground;
and that the other, through the agitation of
conscious guilt and superstitious terror, either
turned giddy, or stumbled over a stone, and
falling down, was immediately exposed to the
full current of the vapour. This is agreeable
to what is found to take place in the celebrated
Grotto del Cane, which is entered with impunity
by men, but is fatal to a dog (whose
head is so much nearer to the ground) if the
poor beast is compelled to remain over one of
the fissures from which the gas issues.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ordeal, however, was a very uncertain
one, from the variations occurring in the quantity
of vapour emitted. Sometimes both parties
were suffocated, and oftener both escaped
unhurt; and in some instances, as might have
been expected, it happened that a person
whose character had been cleared by the
ordeal, was afterwards, by circumstances subsequently
brought to light, proved, or violently
suspected, to have been guilty.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Instances of this kind, in conjunction with
the advancement of intellectual culture, gradually
weakened, in progress of time, the belief
in the supernatural character of the ordeal.
It was, however, for a long time, frequently appealed
to, both by women and men, from all the
states; and, in spite of laws which were passed,
but which it was found impossible fully to enforce,
prohibiting any such trial, and denouncing
as murder the offence of being accessary to any
one’s exposure to it in case of a fatal result,—the
custom still received the sanction of many
who disavowed all belief of miraculous interference
in the case of such trials.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They defended,” said Mr. Adamson, “by
nearly the same arguments as I have lately heard
from you, both duels, such as you apply the
name to, and these which were always very
justly regarded as a kind of duel; since there is
no essential difference between calling on your
adversary to stand a pistol-shot or a poisonous
blast. It was conducive, they contended, to
the preservation of good manners, and of a
high and delicate sense of honour in both
sexes, that a man should be restrained from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>ungentlemanly behaviour, and from lightly
taxing another with it, by the apprehension
of personal danger; and that female purity
should be guarded in like manner. ‘It is,’
they said, ‘a useful additional check against
lying, for instance, and against rashly charging
another with being a liar, to reflect on the probable
consequence of being called on to face
the sword or pistol, or the goblin cavern of
Mount Peril. And it is but fair, that a woman
also should recollect that levity of conduct,
or wanton slander, may occasion her to
be required to undergo a similar danger.’
There were not wanting many who reprobated
this doctrine, and urged such arguments
on the other side respecting the wickedness
and the absurdity of the custom as we have
lately heard from Mr. Jones. But they were
urged with as little practical effect as they
appear to have had among you. At length,
several persons of the higher classes, and remarkable
for correctness of life, refinement of
manners, and cultivated understanding, formed
themselves into an association and declared
strenuous war against every kind of duel, including,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>as has been said, under that name
the ordeal of the cavern, which they contended
against on entirely new grounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They did not confine themselves to such
topics as had been before, again and again,
urged without effect; but maintained that the
practice tended to defeat the very end proposed,
and to lower (instead of raising, as was
pretended) the tone of manners in the society.
‘If,’ they said, ‘there were no such custom,
then, any one, whether man or woman, who
transgressed the rules which public opinion had
sanctioned in the circle of society in which
he or she moved, would at once be excluded
from that circle. And the apprehension of this
exclusion, of thus losing caste, and being sent
to Coventry, which is the ultimate penalty
that such a society can inflict for a breach of
its rules, would be the best preventive of any
violation of them,—the best preservative of the
tone of the society, that it is possible to attain.
If, under such a system, any one insulted another,
he would be regarded as an ill-mannered
brute, and excluded from good company: a
woman who displayed levity of conduct would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>be at once excluded from reputable society: any
one, man or woman, who should bring rash imputations
against a neighbour, would be shunned
as a slanderer: and so of the rest. But
under the system of duelling, society offers an
<i>alternative</i>; the only effect of which, as far as
it operates, is unmixed evil. Instead of saying,
absolutely, you must abstain from brutal
insolence of demeanour, on pain of being excluded
from our circle, it says, you must <i>either</i>
abstain from insolence, <i>or</i> be ready to expose
your life; instead of requiring a woman to
abstain from levity of conduct, and defamatory
language, on pain of forfeiting the countenance
of respectable people, it proposes the alternative
of <i>either</i> observing those rules, <i>or</i> the being
prepared to encounter the ordeal; and the
result is, that those who possess personal intrepidity
will often be enabled to transgress with
impunity those rules of good society, which
the duelling system professes to enforce. Nay
more; the system tends to invest with a
certain degree of dignity, arising from our
admiration of personal courage, such conduct
as would otherwise excite only unmitigated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>abhorrence and contempt. An insolent man,
for instance, if by his insolence he braved no
danger but that of expulsion from good company,
would be simply despised: but since he
also, under the other system, braves the danger
of death, he obtains some degree of honour for
his intrepidity. And though some may be
deterred from such conduct by the fear of a
challenge, others, on the contrary, may be
encouraged to it, by a desire of displaying
valour; especially if they have reason to think,
from what they know of the other party, that
a challenge will <i>not</i> ensue, and that they shall
enjoy their triumph unmolested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Moreover, the magnitude of the injuries
which one person actually can do to another
is infinitely enhanced by the system of duels,
because every affront offered is thus made to
carry with it an imputation on one’s personal
courage, which can only be wiped out by the
exposure of life. If, for instance, I am a man
of uniform and scrupulous veracity, and some
ill-mannered ruffian gives me the lie, then,
supposing duels unknown, the attack recoils
entirely on the assailant. He is incapable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>proving his charge—my life refutes it,—and
the only result is that <i>he</i>, not I, is set down
as a liar, for having falsely called me a liar.
But under the other system, I must go out
and expose my life, or else I am disgraced—disgraced,
not as a <i>liar</i> (for <i>that</i> imputation,
perhaps, is disbelieved after all), but as a
<i>coward</i>, for not daring to risk my life in
defence of my honour. And thus a person,
who otherwise might have been incapable of
doing me any serious hurt at all, has it in
his power to propose to me at his pleasure
the alternative of hazard to my life and violence
to my conscience, or ignominy. A venom
is thus added to the sting of the most contemptible
insect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘So much,’ said they, ‘for the protection
thus provided for us against injuries the
most painful to the feelings! Great part of
the disgrace attaching to the authors of such
injuries is removed; the injuries are probably
rather increased than diminished in frequency;
and in the pain they inflict, they are undoubtedly
aggravated tenfold.’ With regard to the
supposed necessity for a person’s thus vindicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>his own honour in certain cases, on the
ground that the parties have no common authority
to appeal to, this they flatly denied.
The public opinion of the society they belong
to, <i>is</i> that common authority. And that it is
so, and is competent to decide effectually, is
proved, they urged, by the very existence of
duelling; for the duel itself is enforced by
nothing else but public opinion. I am obliged,
it is said, to challenge a man who has affronted
me, because there is no authority to appeal
to that will compel him to redress the injury.
But what, then, compels him to <i>accept</i> the
challenge? Nothing, but the knowledge that
if he refused it, society would reject him as
disgraced. Then, why should not society at
once pronounce on him this sentence of disgrace
for the affront itself, unless he makes
a satisfactory submission? If he defies public
opinion, and does not care for disgrace, he need
not accept the challenge: if he does care for
public opinion, then let the disgrace attach at
once to the offering of the affront, instead of
to the refusal of the challenge. It is manifest
that those who have the power to propose the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>alternative, of either suffering disgrace or fighting,
must have the power to discard the latter
part of the alternative. Let society, therefore,
but do its duty, and it is plain that it may, by
a proper exertion of the power which it has,
and which it actually exercises even now, restrain,
and restrain much more effectually, without
duelling, the very evils which duelling professes
to remedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for the case of war between independent
states, this,” observed Mr. Adamson, “by
the way, is by no means a parallel to that
of private duels. One nation does not <i>send a
challenge</i> to another; because, as the parties
really have no common authority to refer to,
the aggressors would of course decline the challenge,
and <i>would</i> prefer enjoying unmolested
the fruits of their injustice. The nation, therefore,
which considers itself aggrieved has no
other remedy than, after complaining and demanding
redress in vain, to declare war, levy
troops, and commence hostilities against its
opponents without waiting for their consent;
and  this procedure would be parallel to the
case of duels only, if these were quite of a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>character from what they are. If it
were customary for a man who had received an
affront to declare <i>war</i> against his neighbour, arm
himself, and <i>proceed to attack</i> him without asking
his consent, this would correspond to a war
between two states. But a <i>challenge</i> is quite a
different thing; it is an invitation which a man
may either accept or decline, to meet at a time
and place settled by mutual agreement, where
the parties, by common consent, expose themselves
to a certain specified risk. Generally,
the challenge is both sent and accepted, not
from motives of revenge, but from fear of public
censure: but universally, the party challenged
might refuse it if he were willing to
brave public censure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So far, therefore, is a duel from being a
mode of repelling injury, which a man is driven
to resort to through the want of any common
authority to appeal to, that, on the contrary,
every duel actually rests on a tacit appeal to
such an authority—viz. to public opinion;
since no one could compel another to afford
him the satisfaction sought except through the
influence of the fear of disgrace, the other being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>at liberty to refuse the challenge if he dares
to set public opinion at defiance. Every duel,
therefore, whether actually taking place, or
merely talked of and threatened, is itself a
complete disproof of the plea on <i>which</i> duels
are justified.”</p>

against Duelling.—Ruffians and Calumniators.—Association

<p class='c010'>“That public opinion, if rightly directed, is
capable,” continued Mr. Adamson, “of completely
affecting the desired object without the
duel, even better than with it, which is what
we of the present day are so happy as to know
by experience, these reformers anticipated partly
from the enforcement among ladies of the
laws of female honour before that absurd ordeal
had been instituted. Women moving in circles
of good society had kept up its character, it
was observed, at least as well before the ordeal
came into use, and quite as well as men of a
corresponding class maintained the laws of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>masculine honour; and this was effected simply
by a tacit agreement among women of
character not to associate with any woman who
was known to have violated these rules. ‘If,
therefore,’ said they, ‘ladies will return to this
system, and gentlemen will adopt a corresponding
one, the rules of good society, whatever
they may be that it thinks fit to impose, will
be enforced by the simple expedient of denouncing
exclusion against the violators of
them, absolutely, and without offering the alternative
of a duel.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was remarked, indeed, by some of you,”
said Mr. Adamson, “that in Europe the ladies,
and also some other classes of persons who are
exempted from the liability to a duel, are apt
to avail themselves of this exemption by a less
scrupulous adherence to truth and to courtesy
of language, or by throwing such aspersions on
their neighbours as would involve in personal
danger those not so privileged; and such instances
of falsehood, insolence, and calumny
were attributed by some of you to the absence
of the salutary check of the duel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As to the precise state of the fact, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>you appeared not to be quite agreed: but admitting
the most unfavourable representation
to be true, you may perceive, even from what
comes under your own experience, without resorting
to ours, that the inference drawn is not
correct; for it appears by your own account
that the English women, of the higher classes
at least, though all kinds of duel are unknown
among them, yet keep up the character of
their society in respect of female purity. And,
as this is effected through the direct influence
of public opinion,—by simply enforcing the
penalty of exclusion on any female of blemished
reputation,—it is evident that if in respect of
veracity, integrity, or any other point, they fall
short of what is required of gentlemen, this
must arise from the standard of <i>honour</i> being
different in the two sexes. I collect that
among you the character of ‘an honest woman’
does not coincide with that of ‘an honest
man,’—and that even the word ‘virtue’ has
a somewhat different signification in reference
to women and to men. It cannot be therefore
that public opinion is insufficient to enforce
the laws of honour without the intervention of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>duels, since modest women do succeed in maintaining
the purity of the society in which they
move; but the laws of honour are themselves
not the same among ladies and among gentlemen.
The fact is, few persons, either men or
women, will venture to incur infamy; and
<i>that</i> is the penalty <i>which</i> society may denounce
against the violation of its rules, be those rules
what they may. Let society determine what
shall be the point of honour for each sex, or
class of persons, or for all, and denounce the
penalty of exclusion against such as violate its
rules; and that those rules will be generally
observed, without the intervention of duelling,
is proved by the very circumstance that women
enforce their own law of honour as successfully
as men do theirs!</p>

<p class='c011'>“By acting on these principles,” continued
Mr. Adamson, “you would have the additional
advantage of imposing a restraint on those females,
and others, who, you complain, are disposed
to take advantage of their exemption
from danger of a challenge by indulging in defamatory
or insolent language, &#38;c.; for, as I just
now observed, conduct of this kind is regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>among you with somewhat the less of unmixed
disgust and contempt, from the very circumstance
that among laymen of a certain station
it may lead to a duel. It is considered as in
some degree a mark of ‘spirit.’ The courage
which braves death, even when disapproved
as a brutal kind of courage, yet shelters its
possessor from the last extreme of ignominy.
Now, though the degree of false dignity with
which insolent behaviour is thus invested <i>ought</i>
certainly to be at least confined to those who
actually do run a risk in displaying it,—though
women and clergymen, for instance, since they
run no risk, and consequently display no courage
by such behaviour as would expose a layman
to personal danger, should properly be
considered base as well as unmannerly when
they are guilty of it,—yet this distinction is one
which we cannot expect will be carefully kept
in view and uniformly observed. A kind of
association of ideas is created in people’s minds
between what is called ‘spirited behaviour,’
‘strong language,’ &#38;c. and ‘manly boldness;’
and this association continues to affect their
judgment even in cases where no boldness is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>really displayed, because no danger is encountered.
Thus, such conduct, in a woman for
instance, or in a clergyman, as would otherwise
incur unmixed contempt, is likely to be,
if not altogether honoured or approved, at least
in some degree tolerated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But let the system be changed, and the
tone of manners in <i>all</i> classes would be raised.
When duels are unheard of, such offences as
are now regarded with a mitigated disapprobation
on account of the personal intrepidity
which they are supposed sometimes to imply
in the offenders, would become the subject of
unmixed disgust; the only danger braved being
that of the disesteem of reputable people.
And <i>this</i> kind of penalty extending to <i>all</i>
classes and both sexes alike, (at least among
the gentry,) would of course tend to restrain all
of them alike within the rules of honour and
politeness. There may be some reason why,
among you, a woman should not be called out
to <i>fight</i>; but there could be none, why she
should not incur, as well as a gentleman, the
penalty, when that was the <i>sole</i> penalty for
both sexes alike, of <i>exclusion</i> from good society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>if she transgressed its rules: a penalty which
in fact actually <i>is</i> enforced, with unrelenting
strictness, for a violation of the rules of what
is now accounted feminine honour.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such nearly,” continued Mr. Adamson, “was
the train of argument, as far as applicable to
the then-existing condition of society among us,
which was strenuously urged, and assiduously
circulated by the association against duels which
I have alluded to. The novelty of the arguments
contributed, along with their intrinsic
force, and the high character of those who
urged them, to excite a general and serious
attention; and the judicious course pursued by
the authors of the undertaking secured them
ultimate success. The members of the association
bound themselves, by a solemn compact
with each other, never to give or accept a challenge
to any kind of duel, whether by the ordeal,
or by single combat; never to behave in
such a manner as might otherwise have afforded
occasion for a duel; and not to countenance or
receive into their society any one who should
violate either of the above rules. In cases of
personal assault, they were at liberty to defend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>themselves by force on the spot; but not to
seek any subsequent satisfaction, except by an
appeal to the laws, and by agreeing to shun the
society of the offender as of a ruffian. They
were to defend themselves against slander by
<i>living it down</i>—by giving the false accuser the
lie in their conduct; but they were to seek no
other redress (unless they thought fit to bring a
legal action for defamation) than by excluding
calumniators from their society.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the same in respect of rude and insolent
language: into <i>their</i> society, no daring ruffian,
however expert in snuffing a candle with a bullet,
could, as formerly, <i>fight</i> his way, by inducing
those who really thought him no fit
company for gentlemen, by a tacit appeal to
their personal fears to admit him as an associate;
each inwardly wishing all the while
that one of the others would undertake the
perilous task of tying the bell round his neck.
Every such person, and every one in any way
of exceptionable character, was under the ban of
hopeless exclusion. It was useless to challenge
the excluders, since they had proclaimed that
they would not fight. From personal violence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>they appealed to the law: insolent vituperation
was unavailing; since being directed against
men who had abjured duels, it was understood
to imply no personal risk, and consequently to
give no proof of courage. From well-founded
accusations, their blameless life and decorous
behaviour secured them; unfounded charges
only proclaimed the authors of them to be
themselves liars.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very early in the history of this association,
a question arose among its members, on the
decision of which, probably, their final success
turned. It was at first designed that they
should continue formally to enrol as members as
many unexceptionable persons as could be induced
to join their society. Some of their number,
however, objected that this would be likely
to impede their progress in the reformation they
were aiming at. A jealousy, they said, would
be likely to arise in the minds of some persons
against the pretensions, real or supposed, of an
association of which they were not themselves
the founders or leaders. They would therefore
be apt perversely to refuse joining it, as disdaining
to follow in the wake of others; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>would then set about justifying their conduct
by exciting suspicion and organizing opposition,
as against a party combining to set up themselves
as arbiters of good manners,—guides to
the rest of the world,—a self-constituted tribunal,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These representations prevailed; and a resolution
was adopted, and publicly announced,
(accompanied with a frank statement of the
reasons for it,) not to admit formally from
thenceforth any more persons as members, except
such as might have been actually engaged
in a duel, and were desirous of thus solemnly
and publicly proclaiming their renunciation of
a practice to which they had thus once lent
their countenance. But all other persons of
respectable character, it was declared, should
be thenceforth regarded as virtually members
of the association, without any formal admission
or engagement, so long as they should continue
in practice to comply with the fundamental
rules of the society, by abstaining from
duels, and from everything calculated to provoke
a challenge, and by shunning the company
of those who acted otherwise. If any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>should in practice violate these regulations, or
should openly proclaim his determination not
to adhere to them, then, and then only, he was
to be regarded as excluded from the number of
the associates.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In all cases of dispute arising between one
gentleman or lady and another, the cause was
to be referred to the decision, not of any self-appointed
tribunal, nor of any formally-elected
court of honour (either of which might have
furnished occasion for jealousy), but of a committee
of the neighbours meeting for the purpose,
with the stipulation only that they should
be persons received in good society and adverse
to duelling. Of such persons, each of the parties
chooses (for the custom was adopted, and
still exists among us,) one or two of his acquaintance,—each
of whom again names two
or three others as assessors,—and the judges
thus nominated privately hear and try the
cause, calling in, in case of much difficulty or
disagreement, the assistance of others. It is
seldom that the parties do not readily acquiesce
in the decision; and the public in general are,
as you may suppose, fully prepared to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>that this must be at least more likely to approach
to a right judgment than a pistol-ball
or a blast of choke-damp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In this way it was that the custom of
duels gradually, and not very slowly, went out
of fashion among us. It has been wholly extinct
for more than a century; for my father,
who, as I mentioned just now, remembered as
a boy the final prevalence of this reform, was
born nearly one hundred and thirty years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If the same reform,” he added, “is not
effected by the gentry of Europe, when they
have only to <i>will</i> that it should be so, their
claims to a high degree of civilization and
refinement (to say nothing of humanity or morality)
can hardly be admitted. For example,
as it is, any one who offers an affront to another,
and on being challenged refuses to fight,
is excluded from the pale of good society; unless
it be a woman—a clergyman—a quaker—a
person bound over to keep the peace, under
the penalty of forfeiting a sum of money—(a
curious exemption this!)—or belonging to some
other description of privileged persons. All
you have to do is to resolve that the <i>offering</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>of the affront shall place any person under the
same ban as he is now placed under for refusing,
after being challenged for the affront,
to fight. Lay down this rule; and let there be
<i>no exemptions</i> on the ground of sex, profession,
or any other plea whatever, and the object is
accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rough Notes.—Public Entertainments.—Dancing.—Grotesque
Dance.—Throwing the Spear.—Female Dress.—Decorations.—Ear-rings.—Wedding-rings.—Anomalous
Costume.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rough notes taken down by the several
members of the exploring party are, of course,
not arranged in the order of the subjects, but
are merely memoranda written on the spot
from time to time according as the knowledge
was obtained, or the observations made; and in
the selections here laid before the reader, it has
been thought best not to attempt any systematic
arrangement, but to present them in their original
miscellaneous form.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the travellers were at Bath,—which
is a city rather distinguished, like its namesake
in England and in Germany, for gaiety, as being
a place of resort to strangers on account
of the mineral waters,—they were invited to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>several public entertainments of various kinds,
and of different degrees of solemnity and splendour.
One lady with whom, among others,
they were conversing on the subject of one of
these which they were about to attend, on being
asked, among other inquiries, whether a ball
possessed as much attraction for young people
as, they told her, it does in Europe, replied in
the affirmative; though, for her own part, she
said, she liked archery better; but different
young people, said she, differ, you know, in
their tastes in respect of amusements.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the gay party had been assembled,—which
was on a lawn of considerable extent,
partially shaded with some fine mimosa and
eucalyptus (gum-tree), under whose shade tents
were erected,—the travellers witnessed with
much interest the several diversions that were
going on; and, among others, their notice was
called by the lady with whom they had been
conversing the day before to several “games of
ball” of various kinds that were going on;
some played by gentlemen alone, some by
ladies, and some by both together; and many
of them bearing more or less resemblance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the English games of cricket, bowls, trap-ball,
tennis, billiards, &#38;c. as well as to others which
are common enough among children in England,
but quite unknown among adults.</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers laughed heartily (as the ladies
did also, on receiving an explanation) at the
mutual mistake they had made about balls:
but, on making more particular inquiries about
dancing, they learned that this was an amusement
confined to children; scarcely any ever
joining in that sport except those under thirteen
or fourteen years old, and any lively and
good-humoured friend of the children, who
joined their game for their amusement. The
sport was in fact “playing at being savages,”
the dances consisting in a ludicrous imitation
of those of the aborigines. These, it is well
known, are much given to dancing, in which
they display considerable ingenuity as well as
agility and good ear; and their dances are not
merely a recreation, but are also mixed up
with their most important institutions and
transactions, being performed with much solemnity
at their “corrobories,” or grand meetings,
for the purpose of deliberating on affairs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of state, and performing certain superstitious
rites of divination.</p>

<p class='c011'>A group of romping boys and girls, who were
at play in one corner of the field, were accordingly
requested to exhibit to the strangers the
spectacle of a dance; and some of the most
forward and lively of the boys entered into the
proposal with much glee. Two of the party
took on themselves, by general consent, the
arrangement and direction of the whole, and
seemed to officiate as masters of the ceremonies,
or, as they called themselves, “Corrobory
chiefs.” They were, it seems, visitors from one
of the back-settlements, and had had frequent
opportunities of witnessing the native dances.
The sport partook somewhat of the nature of
a masquerade; some whimsical changes being
made in the costume of the dancers, in order to
give the livelier representation of the strange
originals. Much merriment took place, and
many curious feats of grotesque agility were
displayed, to the great diversion both of the
juvenile performers and the bystanders. This
sport was followed by the throwing of the spear,
after the manner of the natives; an art in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>which many of the Southlanders are very expert,
especially those who live on the margins
of the lakes, where the striking of fish is a
favourite diversion, as the salmon-spearing is
in some parts of Scotland. The throwing of
the spear at a mark, however, and also archery,
are games not confined, as dancing is, to children.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Southlanders expressed surprise that
adult Europeans, even of the higher classes,
should retain the amusement of dancing, “like
the savages;” an amusement which seemed to
them, from habit, as childish as many of their
sports, on the other hand, had appeared to
their visitors. Both parties were somewhat at
a loss to explain to each other the grounds
of their respective notions as to what was or
was not puerile. “There is no disputing,”
said one of the most intelligent of their hosts,
“about tastes; but in many points, I believe,
ours are to be accounted for by that early and
deep-seated association in our minds, which
you have in many instances noticed, between
certain practices or habits and savage life. You
have remarked several times how frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the phrase is in our mouths, that to do so and
so is ‘like the savages;’ and this may perhaps
account for the ridiculous appearance which,
as you perceive, one of your balls, as you call
them, would have in our eyes.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>The sentiment above alluded to was manifested
in several conversations (occurring at
various places, and noticed from time to time
in the memorandum-books of the travellers,) on
the subject of dress, especially female dress;
respecting which the ladies showed themselves,
as was to be expected, inquisitive and communicative.
They generally expressed their
wonder, when the female costume of England
was described, that people pretending to be
so civilized should expose so much <i>bare flesh</i>,
“like the savages.” The habit of dressing, or
rather, as they said, of undressing, so as to display
naked shoulders, bosoms, and arms, struck
them more as barbarian than as indelicate;
they themselves,—though their clothing is
usually thin, on account of the general warmth
of the climate,—leave no part of the body
uncovered, except the face and hands. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>inquired whether the European ladies coat
themselves with grease, mixed up with ochre
or other paint, as the savages do, by way of
protection to the unclothed parts from scorching
sun, piercing winds, and the bites of mosquitoes;
also, whether they practised the tattooing,
which is an essential part of aboriginal
finery.</p>

<p class='c011'>They inquired also whether English ladies
did not suffer in their health from the great
and sudden <i>changes</i>, from covering to exposure,
of many parts of the body between morning
and evening dresses; and also whether many
of them did not become diseased or deformed
by the violence with which they appeared to
squeeze their waists. Wilkins, the servant, it
seems, had chanced to bring with him a lady’s
almanac, containing plates of “female costume,”
which excited great interest, wonder, and diversion
among the Southlanders. Some imagined
at first, among other mistakes, that the
ladies were represented as taking precautions
against drowning, by fastening, as the Southlanders
sometimes do, large bladders to their
arms.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>They expressed hardly less wonder on learning
that English ladies are accustomed, “like
the savages,” to wear feathers, necklaces, and
other ornaments, and even to make incisions in
their flesh for the purpose of inserting them.
They asked whether, in addition to ear-rings,
they wore nose-rings, and the ornament so general
among the New-Hollanders, called humorously
by the English sailors the “spritsail-yard;”
viz. the leg-bone of a bird thrust
through the middle cartilage of the nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers observed, in reply, that the
Southlanders, especially the females, seemed to
have no scruples on the subject of ornamental
dress and furniture, as they had much that was
both handsome and costly. “That is true,”
said one of the party; “and though there are
many differences of opinion on the subject, and
some indulge in a degree of attention to ornament
which is regarded by others as excessive,
the total condemnation of all regard to decoration
is by no means common. The church,
indeed, of the Kernhuters—of which I learn
from you there is a considerable and valuable
remnant in Europe—have adopted, for nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>two centuries, some very strict regulations on
this head; among others, they make it a point
of discipline to use no dyes. Their shoes and
boots are brown, of the natural colour of the
leather; their coats grey, being made of a mixture
of black wool and white, as it comes from
the sheep; and their hats of the natural colour
of the opossum and kangaroo: but these are
exceptions. The point <i>agreed on</i> among us,
and in which our difference from you gave rise
to the wonder you heard expressed, is this,—that
it is barbarian to wear anything <i>for the
sake</i> of ornament, and which answers no purpose
but that of decoration. Of this description
are feathers, which were worn by our
ancestors of both sexes, but which I understand
from you are now confined to women, and to
military men when in uniform. So, also, are
necklaces, rings, and, above all, ear-rings. It
strikes us as peculiarly barbarian to bore holes
in the flesh for the purpose of sticking in ornaments.
It may be a prejudice, but it is at
least an ancient one; for the Greeks, though I
believe their women wore ear-rings,—and it is
to be observed that they regarded women as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>very inferior order of beings, and rather as
toys, or as domestic drudges, than as civilized
and rational companions,—considered ear-rings
worn by men as a decisive mark of barbarism.
You may find, in Xenophon’s Anabasis, one of
the captains of companies, who had given some
cowardly advice, reproached as uttering sentiments
unworthy of a Greek; on which some
one exclaimed ‘He is no Greek! <i>his ears are
bored</i>:’ and this being ascertained by inspection,
he was on this evidence at once pronounced a
barbarian, and as such reduced to the ranks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have observed,” continued he, “among
us handsome and costly gold brooches and
buckles, buttons made of jewels, embroidered
garments, inlaid tables, and other such ornamental
articles; but you will see no article
that is <i>merely</i> an ornament. A gold brooch or
button served as a fastening, not better indeed,
but as well, as an iron or brass one. Its <i>beauty</i>
is superfluous, but it is not <i>itself</i> superfluous,
and destitute of all ostensible use. So, also, a
silver goblet serves to drink out of, and an
embroidered gown to cover one, no less than
plain ones. The robes, caps, and thrones of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>our higher magistrates are, as you have seen,
in some instances very highly decorated; but
they have an ostensible use, as coverings and
seats. We have no necklaces, plumes, or rings;
and have indeed carried so far this distinction,
which probably to you seems fanciful, that
we have even laid aside the ancient usage of
the wedding ring, and, as you must have observed,
mark the distinction between the married
and single by the dress. By the bye,” he
added, “the ring, which you speak of as having
a use in distinguishing a married <i>woman</i>, is confined,
I perceive, to the <i>wife</i>; a married <i>man</i>
not having, as among us, any distinctive mark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Sibthorpe here remarked, that though
any practice to which we are not accustomed
does usually appear to us fanciful, yet it occurred
to him—what had never struck him before—that
no <i>mere</i> ornament is commonly worn
by <i>men</i> of the present age in Europe; a few,
indeed, wear rings, but not the majority; nor
is it any requisition of fashion. Stars, ribbons,
crowns, &#38;c. are worn by men as marks of certain
rank or office; but the feathers, chains,
shoulder-knots, and ruffles, which our forefathers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>wore as a part of fashionable dress, are
obsolete. Man is now so far conformed to the
ancient definition as to be “a biped without
<i>feathers</i>;” women, on the contrary, are so far,
according to the Southlanders, in the rear of
advancing civilization as still to wear ornaments,
like the savages.</p>

<p class='c011'>He remarked also another point of coincidence
between European women on the one
side, and European men and the Southlanders
of both sexes on the other; the latter, he observed,
were always dressed <i>alike on both sides</i>,
so that if one imagined one of them split into
halves, the two would <i>match</i>, like a pair of
gloves; among European ladies, on the contrary,
most of the many great variations of
fashion agree in making some difference between
the two sides; there is usually an obliquity
in the head-gear, or a bow, a feather,
or a bunch of flowers, stuck on one side, without
a corresponding one on the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the states, which, as has been mentioned
above, are eleven in number, differ more or less
from each other in their form of government,
but are alike in all the most important and
fundamental principles adopted; several of
which are strangely at variance with everything
that is to be found in the northern hemisphere.
Seven out of the eleven states are denominated
kingdoms: but of these, four only are under
an hereditary royalty; the other three being,
as far as the travellers could ascertain, rather
of the character of republics than of strictly
regal governments; but retaining the title of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>King to denote the chief magistrate for the
time being, somewhat corresponding to the
Athenian archon, Roman consul, or American
president. There are four other states also
which are, in name as well as in substance,
republics. But these differences are greater
in appearance than in reality; the kingdoms
which are the most strictly so called, being by
no means under an unlimited monarchy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of the particulars respecting the constitutions
and laws of the several states the
travellers were of course, during their short
stay, unable to collect, except very slightly and
imperfectly. From those which they did collect,
and ascertain with sufficient certainty, we
shall select such as are likely to be the most
interesting, from their dissimilarity to European
institutions.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in the state of Atroloria,—so called
from the lake of the same name<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> within its
territory,—which the travellers first reached,
that they had the earliest opportunity of witnessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>debates in their senate. They afterwards,
on several occasions, attended the legislative
assemblies in other places. The circumstance
which in the first instance most attracted,
by its novelty to them, the attention of the
visitors, was one which they found on inquiry
was common to all the states in their deliberative
assemblies; being a regulation originally
established by Müller, and afterwards, from
its tried advantage and convenience, continued
universally and uninterruptedly. It was this,
that no member was allowed to <i>speak</i> and to <i>vote</i>
on the same question, but each had his choice
between the two. The proceedings, accordingly,
bore some resemblance to those of a
court of justice in civil causes; the speakers
corresponding to the pleaders who address the
court,—the voters, to the jury, who give the
verdict. The difference is, that each member
has it left to his choice which character he
will take. Any member wishing to address
the house, quits his seat and places himself
in front of the chair of the moderator,—answering
to the speaker or chairman; and
when he has spoken, seats himself, not in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>former place, but, with a view to prevent
mistake or confusion, on a bench appropriated
to the purpose, and thence called the speakers’
bench; or he is at liberty to leave the assembly
if he thinks fit. When the question has
been put to the vote and decided, and a fresh
question is coming on, he resumes his original
seat. Certain public functionaries, who are
not members, have a seat by right on the
speakers’ bench, and are at liberty to address
the house (though they have no vote) when
there is any reference to the business of their
own peculiar departments.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The lake was so called by the early settlers; doubtless from
the same cause which led to the name of our own colony in
Western Australia.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Whether owing to this circumstance, or to
any other, the debates were observed to be
shorter, and the speakers much fewer, than
is usual in European assemblies. They seldom
exceeded two or three on each side.</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers observed that the speakers
rarely used even the smallest degree of action,
but usually kept themselves remarkably still
while speaking. This, it appears, was one of
the results of that general and deep-rooted
association already alluded to. In the course
of conversation on this subject, the Southlanders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>it appeared, considered it as something
uncivilized to use either vociferation or
gesticulation in speaking, “as the savages do.”
They even accounted the refined Athenians
and Romans of old as little better than half-reclaimed
barbarians in this respect, because
they would not attend to an orator unless he
stamped and shouted, and brandished his arms
about, as if he were speaking to a pack of
hounds, instead of to an assembly of rational
beings.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>The travellers were so fortunate as to witness
on one occasion a debate of a peculiar
kind, which is of rare occurrence, and which
served to throw light on the whole system
of legislature of this singular people. It occurred
in the kingdom of Nether-London, one of
the most ancient and populous of all the states.
They found a considerable excitement and
bustle prevailing, though all was orderly and
decorous, on account of a summons issued (in
our phraseology, “a call of the house”) to the
members of their assembly, called in that state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the parliament, to deliberate on the question
of removing a <i>fundamental law</i>. The particular
law then in question was, they found,
like the Salic law of the French, one which
confined the succession to the throne to males.
But a further inquiry let them into the knowledge
of matter far more curious and interesting,—the
general principle of “fundamental
laws,” which materially affects the whole of the
system of legislature in the country; being,
with slight differences of detail, common to all
the states, regal and republican, and extending
also to the several ecclesiastical communities.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The system I am about to describe to
you,” said Mr. Adamson, who was one of their
principal informants on this occasion, “was
established by the Müllers; the younger of
whom, during the whole of his long reign, as
it may be called, laboured earnestly and successfully
to explain its advantages, and to
perpetuate its adoption. I will put into your
hands presently a little popular tract on the
subject written by him, which, like the many
others he wrote, is in every one’s hands at this
day. He sets forth in that the evils resulting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>on the one hand, from retaining, or, oftener,
vainly striving to retain, all laws, usages, and
institutions unaltered, some of which, even
though the result originally of consummate
wisdom, may become utterly unsuitable to
other times and altered circumstances; and, on
the other hand, from frequent, sudden, and
violent changes, which are apt to agitate and
unsettle men’s minds, and to lead to consequences
not designed or foreseen,—like the
pulling out of one stone from a wall, which
is apt to loosen some of the others. His
discussion of this subject bears much resemblance
to those I lately saw in the little book
you lent me the other day, by Lord Bacon,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
who strikes me as a very able writer, and
likely to be well worthy of the reputation you
tell me he enjoys.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. A little pocket edition of Bacon’s Essays, one of four or five
small volumes which the travellers had brought with them to
beguile any occasional tedious half-hour at their halting-places,
or in their boat.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Müller goes on to say that unwise legislators
have been in all ages apt to bring on
themselves, not one only, but both of these
classes of evils. Unmindful of the proverb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>that “a stitch in time saves nine,” they often,
through dread of change, maintain unaltered
things which manifestly want altering, at the
expense of much loss and inconvenience; and
when the change does come, from the inconvenience
having grown to an intolerable height, it
is apt to be, in consequence, a violent, hasty,
and sometimes ruinous change. ‘That dirt
made this dust,’ is a homely old saying, which he
used frequently to apply in speaking of such instances,
in allusion to those who in wet weather
neglect to scrape off the mud from the roads;
and consequently, besides being for a long time
continually splashed and bemired, at length,
when the mud is all dried up by the sun,
they are half smothered by the dust it produces.
He would always, therefore, he said, be, by
choice, an <i>improver</i>, rather than a <i>reformer</i>; introducing
corrections and additions, from time
to time, as occasion offered, rather than letting
a building become so inconvenient or ruinous
as to require being pulled down and rebuilt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A great reformation he considered as, in
all cases, a great evil; though frequently by far
the least evil that circumstances admit of, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>though he had himself, accordingly, been always
a strenuous supporter of the great reformation
of religion, notwithstanding the many evils resulting,
according to him, from its having been
so long delayed and so obstinately resisted. To
avoid both of the opposite evils,—the liability
to sudden and violent changes, and the adherence
to established usage when inconvenient
or mischievous,—to give the requisite stability
to governments and other institutions without
shutting the door against improvement,—this
is a problem which both ancient and modern
legislators, he thought, had not well succeeded
in solving. And the same, it appears, may be
said of those who have appeared in Europe
since his time. Some, like the ancient Medes
and Persians, and like Lycurgus, have attempted
to prohibit all change; but those who constantly
appeal to the wisdom of their ancestors,
as a sufficient reason for perpetuating everything
these have established, forget two things;
first, that they cannot hope for ever to persuade
all successive generations of men that
there was once one generation of such infallible
wisdom as to be entitled to dictate to all their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>descendants for ever,—so as to make the earth,
in fact, the possession, not of the living, but of
the dead; and, secondly, that, even supposing
our ancestors gifted with such infallibility,
many cases must arise in which it may be
reasonably doubted whether they themselves
would not have advocated, if living, changes
called for by altered circumstances; even as
our own forefathers, who denoted the <i>southern</i>
quarter from <i>meridies</i> (noon), would not have
been so foolish as to retain that language had
they come to live in this hemisphere, where the
sun at noon is in the north.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The expedient of having two or more
deliberative assemblies, or other authorities, in
a state, whose concurrent sanction shall be requisite
for enacting or abrogating laws, has
often been resorted to, as a safeguard against
sudden and violent measures adopted under an
ebullition of feeling, yet without precluding
well-weighed and deliberate changes. This expedient
he thought a very good one, as far as it
goes; it is adopted in various forms in each of
our states. But it appeared to him that experience
had proved this provision to be not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>alone sufficient for accomplishing fully the object
he had in view, which was to give the
requisite stability to those more fundamental
laws which may be considered as part of the
constitution of any state, (yet not so as to attempt
prohibiting a wary and deliberate alteration
of them,) and at the same time to afford
proper facilities for introducing changes into
matters of detail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Nature,’ said he, ‘does not give the same
degree of strength to the footstalks of the leaves
of a tree,—destined, as these are, to be shed
every year,—and to the roots, which are designed
to hold the trunk fast in the ground.
If she did, either the one would be far too
strong or the other far too weak, or both of
these inconveniences might take place at once;
yet this is the error committed by almost all
governments. The same machinery is provided
to facilitate or to impede <i>every</i> change
alike, in great or in small matters; the same
mode is prescribed for the maintaining, or abrogating,
or introducing of <i>every</i> law and <i>every</i>
institution alike. Among you, for instance, an
act for regulating the manufacture of soap, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>an act which should introduce a complete
change into your constitution,—which should
take away or restore the liberties of half the
nation,—must go through exactly the same
forms, and be passed or rejected by the same
authorities under the same regulations: in short,
you are like a tree whose leaf-stalks and main
roots have neither more nor less toughness and
stoutness the one than the other.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now this is a state of things which he
considered as always inexpedient, and often
dangerous, and which he accordingly proposed
to remedy. The system which he recommended,
and which has been universally adopted, is
this. All our laws are divided into two classes;
the ordinary or repealable laws, and the fundamental.
The former are enacted, altered, or
repealed much in the same manner as all laws
of all other nations: but a fundamental law
is one which there exists no immediate power
to enact, annul, or amend; and it is forbidden
by the rules of the house to propose any measure
that, even incidentally, goes to defeat or
interfere with the operation of any fundamental
law. But it is allowed to propose, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>pass, a bill for removing any fundamental law
from the list, and reducing it to an ordinary
law; after which, it is open to be dealt with
like any other law. So, also, it is allowed to
pass a bill for placing any already existing ordinary
law on the list of fundamentals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The enactment, therefore, or repeal of a
fundamental law, may be accomplished at <i>two</i>
steps, though not at one; but it is further provided
that these two steps shall not take place
in one session of parliament.” [He was describing
the details, he said, in the terms, and
according to the usages, of the kingdom of
Nether-London; having premised that there is
a substantial agreement in principle throughout
all the states on this subject.] “When it is
proposed to remove a law from the list of fundamentals,
the motion made is, ‘that such and
such a law shall, <i>at the close of the present
session</i>, cease to be fundamental.’ It remains,
therefore, even should the motion be carried,
and the act receive the royal assent, irrevocable
during the existing session. When, again, the
reverse measure is to be proposed, of enrolling
on the list of fundamentals some existing law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>an act must have first passed, authorizing the
legislature to take into consideration, in the
<i>ensuing</i> (or some subsequent session) the question
of enrolling such and such a law.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lastly, another and more important safeguard
against precipitancy, is that, in the case
of a motion for removing any law from the
list of the fundamentals, or adding one to that
list, every member who does not vote <i>for</i> the
motion is, by a rule of the house, reckoned,
whether present or absent, as having voted
<i>against</i> it. In other words, such a motion can
be carried only by an <i>absolute</i> majority of the
whole house, not by a mere comparative majority
of members <i>present</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Sibthorpe having interposed a remark,
that there is something in the British constitution
of the nature of a fundamental law, inasmuch
as it is treason to propose the abolition of
kingly government,—so that the maintenance
of that government is irrevocable till a bill shall
first have been passed for altering the laws of
treason,—Mr. Adamson admitted that this was
so far on the same footing with the law he had
been describing; “but,” added he, “if any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>should—which I allow is highly improbable—propose
such an alteration of the laws of treason,
that question might legally be put to the
vote in as thin a house as is competent to
transact ordinary business. I think you would
do well, after introducing our last regulation as
to an absolute majority, to place some more
of your laws on the same footing. Not that
there would be any occasion for saying anything
about treason. With you, as with us, it
would no doubt be quite sufficient that a member
should be at once ‘called to order’ if he
presumed to make any motion contrary to the
rules of the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would find, I think,” he continued,
“that the adoption of our system in regard
to fundamental laws would tend to promote
among you that comparative calmness and moderation
which you have remarked in our proceedings,
and to mitigate the vehemence with
which, by your accounts, one set of men oppose
every change, good or bad, while another seem
to be hostile to everything that is established.
Those who are by temper and habit most disposed
to the dread of innovation, lest rash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>schemes should be adopted, would have their
apprehensions somewhat calmed by seeing a
provision made at least against any great
change being introduced with inconsiderate
<i>haste</i>; and those, again, who are most disposed
to dread the perpetuation of abuses,
might be moderated in their impatient eagerness
for reform, by seeing a regular path open
for the examination and remedy of anything,
however consecrated by long usage, that should
appear, on mature deliberation, to be evil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That you would be exempt from the possibility
of error, or that we are so, it would be an
absurd presumption to pretend. Our system
does not profess to make human judgment infallible;
it professes only to provide that our
deliberative assemblies shall decide according
to the <i>best</i> of their judgment, and shall neither
retain nor reject anything, without a full opportunity
at least being given for the exercise of
deliberate reflection and mature discussion. To
attempt more than this is mere folly. One generation
of fallible men has neither the right
nor the power to supersede for ever, by irrevocable
laws, the judgment of all future generations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>of their posterity; though the endeavour
to do so may delay a beneficial change,
and convert it, when it does come, into a noxious
one. The will of a whole nation can no
more be permanently and effectually stopped
in its course than the current of a river. If
you dam up the regular channel, you cause it
first to flood the neighbouring country, and
then to work itself new and circuitous channels.
You may think yourself well off if this is the
worst. Should your dam be ultimately burst,
a fierce and destructive deluge of revolutionary
violence will succeed.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>The debate which the visitors witnessed,
and which led to the foregoing explanations,
terminated in the removal of the law in question
from the list of fundamentals. But as
the minority had been considerable, the general
expectation was, that before the next session,—in
which alone the final repeal of the law
could be proposed,—a dissolution of parliament
would take place, in order that the sentiments
of the people on the subject might be fully
ascertained.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mode of Election of Senators—of Representatives.—Personal
Votes and Property-Votes.—Voting by Ballot.—Eligibility of
Candidates.—Aboriginal Blood.—Mixed Blood.—Government
Rent.—Public Expenditure.—Unwise Economy.—Choice of
Statesmen.—Explanations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Adamson,—properly designated as the
worshipful Christopher Adamson,—being himself
a member of the senate of his own state
of Bath, obtained for the strangers, as a special
favour, permission to witness the mode of
election of a senator to fill up a vacancy which
had just occurred.</p>

<p class='c011'>He explained to them, that, in this particular
state, the members of the senate, or upper
house, are elected by the lower house (or commons);
and that the appointment is for life,
or till resignation. But though in these particulars
the constitution of this state differs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>from that of several of the others, the <i>mode</i>
of election is similar to that by which several
of the public functionaries are chosen in all
the states. No personal canvassing, he informed
them, is allowed in any case; nor is it regular
to ask or to promise a vote. But at
the time of the election, the president or chairman
of the assembly solemnly admonishes the
voters of their obligation to divest themselves,
as far as possible, of all personal bias, and
nominate such persons as they shall in their
consciences believe to be most fit. Admonitions
of this kind stand in the place of the
oaths which in Europe are usually administered
on such occasions. The commons-assembly
having been duly convened, each member
was directed to write down on separate
slips of paper, and deliver to the president,
the names of five persons as candidates; or,
not <i>more</i> than five: for he was at liberty to
write fewer; or, if he pleased, none at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>The president next proceeded to inspect
their names, and select the five that had the
greatest number of votes. It so happened on
this occasion that there were <i>six</i> names, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>which two had each the same number of votes.
This, as Mr. Adamson explained, creates no
difficulty, and only prolongs in a trifling degree
the business of the election. All six names
were put in nomination; and each member
was next called on to give his vote <i>against</i>
one of the six, by giving in a paper inscribed
with the name of the candidate he wished to
have struck off the list. The one who had
the greatest number of these counter-votes
being then removed from the list, the remaining
five were proposed in like manner, to have
one name struck off; and the same process
was repeated till only one remained, who
was thereupon declared duly elected. For
example: suppose the five names that, in the
first instance, have most votes, to be <span class='fss'>A</span>, <span class='fss'>B</span>, <span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>,
and <span class='fss'>E</span>, and these being put in nomination, in
the counter-voting <span class='fss'>A</span> has the most votes against
him; then <span class='fss'>B</span>, <span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>, and <span class='fss'>E</span> are proposed in like
manner, and <span class='fss'>B</span> is struck off by a majority of
counter-votes; there remain <span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>, and <span class='fss'>E</span>, from
which, by the same process, <span class='fss'>C</span> and <span class='fss'>D</span> are
successively struck off: then <span class='fss'>E</span> is the one
elected.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>If in any case the number of counter-votes
against two of the names are equal, and that
number exceeds the votes against any other
one, then <i>both</i> names are struck off, except
it should happen that they are the <i>last</i> two; in
which case, of course, the question is, whether
<span class='fss'>D</span> or <span class='fss'>E</span> shall be elected: and if on this question
the numbers are equal, the president has the
casting vote.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Adamson was about to answer the
inquiries of the visitors as to the peculiar
advantages proposed by this mode of election,
when a blunt, humorous-looking commoner,
who sat near them, interposed, by telling them
that, in plain terms, this was the advantage;
that each voter placed his <i>own friend</i> first,
and the <i>best candidate</i> second, and so the best
was elected in the end. Mr. Adamson replied
with a smile, that, making due allowance for
satire, there was a good deal of truth in the
statement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a truth,” said he, “that has been
presented to you, dressed with vinegar alone,
which you may easily suppose might fairly
be tempered with a due proportion of oil. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>I will leave that to your own reflections; only
reminding you of the well-known instance
of the Grecian states discussing the respective
merits of the several commanders after the
overthrow of Xerxes. Each state, it was observed,
placed <i>their own</i> commander first on
the list of merit, and allotted the second
place to Themistocles the Athenian; whence
it was reasonably inferred that Themistocles
was clearly the most distinguished of all. Now,
suppose he had been candidate for a prize in
some assembly in which the Athenians were
not present; he would not, you observe, have
obtained a single vote according to the direct
mode of voting, while on our plan he would
have gained a decisive triumph. I have heard
also of a new-comer in some town consulting
each of his neighbours as to the choice of a
physician, and fixing on the one whom most
of them accounted the second-best; each placing
his own family physician first.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>The travellers having inquired into the mode
of appointment of the lower house, were informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>that the members are the representatives
each of a certain town or district, as in
England, America, &#38;c.; and that they are
elected for seven years at the utmost; one-seventh
of the house, by lot, going out every
year, but being capable, however, of re-election.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is, besides this, a power lodged in a
certain council of state and president,—for this
state is a republic,—to dissolve the house and
appoint a general election. In all the states
there is a house of representatives, constituted
substantially on the same principle. In their
designations, and in some points of detail, there
are several differences.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the election of members all citizens have,
in most of the states, a vote, though not all
<i>equal</i> votes. Any citizen, who is unconvicted
of any crime, of sound mind, and of a certain
specified age, (in the state of Bath it is thirty-five,)
is entitled to be enrolled as a voter, on
producing a certificate of his having gone
through a certain course of elementary school-learning,
and attained the required proficiency.
He is then entitled to what is called a <i>personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>vote</i>; <i>i. e.</i> a vote without any reference to the
amount of his property. In Bath, and some of
the other states, an individual may have conferred
on him the honour and privilege of a
double or treble personal vote, in consideration
of peculiar public services or personal qualifications.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides this, each individual who may pay
a certain <i>proportion</i> of taxes,—<i>i. e.</i> who may
possess a certain amount of taxable property,—is
entitled, on that ground, to a <i>property-vote</i>;<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
if he has a certain greater amount specified,—which
is more, however, than double the first,—he
has a second property-vote; and so on,
up to a certain limited number. In the republic
of Bath, six is the utmost number of
property-votes that one person can hold; but
this varies in the several states; the distinction
of personal and property-votes, and the power
of holding more than one of the latter, are
regulations common to all.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Any property not taxable,—as, for instance, professional income,—the
holder may, if he think fit, enroll as equivalent to so
much land, and pay taxes accordingly, which entitles him to a
corresponding number of votes.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“This part of our system,” Mr. Adamson remarked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>to them, “is not so much unlike that
of Great Britain as you had at the first glance
conceived: for with you, if a man chance to
have landed property in several <i>different counties</i>,
he is entitled to a vote in each; and this
is nearly equivalent to his having several votes
in one county, should all the property chance to
be in that one. The anomaly is with <i>you</i>; in
giving one man more direct influence in the
election of the legislature than another, who,
perhaps, has double his estate, but all within
one county. I say,” continued he, “<i>direct</i> influence;
because, indirectly, a rich man among
you does, it appears, influence his tenants,
tradesmen, and other dependents in their votes.
With us, the weight which property has, and
ought to have, is allowed to operate <i>directly</i>
and <i>openly</i>: with you, on the system of single
votes, it does not.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And accordingly you apprehend, I find, a
danger in the threatened introduction of the
ballot; as tending to place the richest and
poorest on a footing of democratical equality,
by taking away the indirect influence of the
one over the votes of the other. And it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>remarkable that the tendency of the ballot to
produce this effect,—which is manifestly the
great <i>danger</i> to be apprehended from it,—seems
to be <i>asserted</i> by its advocates among you,
and <i>denied</i> by its opponents. With us, on the
contrary, there is no such consequence to be
apprehended; and, accordingly, our voting for
representatives is always by ballot. On our
system, this is not only unobjectionable but
highly important; for, as the successful candidate
is elected by the majority of <i>votes</i>, while
it is possible that his opponent might be supported
by a much greater number of <i>voters</i>, it
would be very inexpedient to let this be publicly
displayed and recorded; as it might tend
to array the wealthier and poorer classes against
each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the whole,” added he, “our system
seems to be the simplest and most effectual for
preserving that principle which <i>must</i> be maintained
in every <i>good</i> representative system; viz.
that <i>persons</i> and <i>property</i> should both be represented.
The democrat aims at a representation
of <i>persons alone</i>; at putting on a political
level those who have the largest stake in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>country, and those who have little or none.
The aristocrat (or rather, oligarchist) is for representing
<i>property alone</i>; as if the <i>taxes</i> imposed
by the legislature towards the expenses
of the state were everything, and the <i>life and
liberty</i> of individuals, which may be affected by
the laws passed, were nothing. The true wisdom,
surely, is to take <i>both</i> into account, and
to provide that both persons and property shall
be duly represented.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>In all the states but one, all persons are eligible
to a seat in the lower house,—that of
representatives,—who possess certain property
and personal qualifications. In that one,—the
kingdom of Upper-London, a small state, which
was separated, above a hundred years since,
from that of Nether-London,—a sort of hereditary
restriction exists, which, at the first
glance, appeared to the travellers exceedingly
whimsical. No one is eligible to their commons’
assembly who is not descended, or married to
one who is, from both blacks and whites.</p>

<p class='c011'>The origin of the regulation was this:—Before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the state was separated, the district which
constitutes its present territory was occupied
by a considerable proportion of blacks, viz. the
descendants of the allied and reclaimed aboriginals
formerly described. It was observed by
the then king of Nether-London, (then called
New-London,) that the whites of pure blood
were beginning to hold aloof, not only from the
blacks, but from those of mixed breed, and to
disdain associating with them on equal terms,
however personally deserving. To remedy this
state of things, and prevent a mutual alienation
between two sets of fellow-citizens, the king,—who
seems to have inherited something of the
eccentric, original, and daring character of the
younger Müller, from a daughter of whom he
was descended,—devised the plan, which, with
the concurrence of the legislature, he carried
into effect, for constituting this district—a
thriving and, in other respects, promising one—into
a distinct state, under some peculiar
regulations.</p>

<p class='c011'>A brother of his own was appointed the first
king of it,—whose wife is said to have been
a lady of beauty and accomplishments, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>she had a slight mixture of aboriginal blood.
Inducements were held out to several of the
most respectable and intelligent persons in
various states who were of mixed race, to
come and settle in the new kingdom. Some
of the ablest of these,—who, by the bye, are
said to have had a considerable over-proportion
of European blood in their veins,—together
with others of purely white race, were nominated
as the original senate (or upper house);
and the lower house was, by a fundamental law,
to consist exclusively, and for ever, of persons
of mixed race, or who are married to such.
And, to this day, no one is eligible who cannot
prove his descent, or his wife’s, from blacks and
whites.</p>

<p class='c011'>This, however, is easily done at present;
for the descent may be ever so remote, the
mixture ever so unequal. Every one, therefore,
is eligible, of whom any ancestor has been
enrolled as such. There are, accordingly, many
members of the house who, perhaps, have not
above ¹⁄₁₆ or ¹⁄₃₂ of aboriginal blood; and, indeed,
most of the population are at present not very
dissimilar from Europeans in feature and complexion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and yet are qualified, as far as the
above rule is concerned, for a seat in the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plan was at first laughed at, as whimsical,
by many of the Southlanders themselves;
but the expediency of it in promoting mutual
respect and speedy amalgamation between the
two races, who were thus <i>both alike excluded</i>
from an important branch of the legislature,
was so apparent, and the joke was so good-humouredly
joined in by those who were the
objects of it, that the laughter was soon divested
of all bitterness. The satirists had suggested,
as a symbol for the new state, two swans,—an
Australian black swan (Cygnus ater) and white
European,—lovingly entwining their necks:
on which the Upper-Londoners immediately
adopted this as the arms of the kingdom; and
so it remains to this day, with the motto of
“Nimium ne crede colori.” The state, though
one of the smaller ones, (its population about
two hundred and fifty thousand,) is prosperous,
and its citizens respectable, intelligent, and
polite.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>In most of the states, there are few or no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>considerable taxes, except a land tax; and
in many of them even this is not heavy, from
the government being in possession of considerable
tracts of land, which in some instances
have become very valuable from having
been covered with buildings, wharfs, &#38;c.
[The word “tax” is used as best conveying to
English ears the sense intended. They themselves
call it “government-<i>rent</i>;” for they consider
the state as alone holding what we call
the fee-simple of all land, which it assigns to
individuals, either for terms of years at a stipulated
rent, or in perpetuity, subject to what we
should call a land-tax.]</p>

<p class='c011'>On the whole, Mr. Sibthorpe is of opinion,
that, taking into consideration the very small
military (and, of course, no naval) establishments,
and also the comparative wealth of these
and the European states, the government revenues
are proportionably greater in the Southland
states than in those of Europe,—the revenue
that is actually <i>expended in the public service</i>
each year; for he does not take into account,
as a part of our revenue, the enormous sum
annually paid as interest on the national debt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>These states having happily been exempt from
the prodigal expenditure of wars, have no national
debt. Their public expenditure is, however,
what we should be apt to call profuse in
the payment of public functionaries. All are
paid, even the representatives; and to most
offices is attached, besides what may be considered
an ample salary in reference to the prevailing
style of living, a comfortable retiring
pension: sinecures however, strictly so called,—<i>i. e.</i>
payments for <i>no</i> services, either present or
<i>past</i>,—are not known. When the more frugal
system, in reference to this point, that prevails
among us, was described to them, and also the
prevailing clamour for still further reductions
on that head, they gave it as their opinion that
there could not be money worse saved, and that
is must be a great wonder if we were well
governed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The natural tendency,” they urged, “of a
system of <i>frugal</i> government in this sense, is,
to obtain a worse commodity. Try the experiment,”
they said, “of being frugal to your physicians,
and reduce their fees to half-crowns,
and you will have a half-crown’s worth of skill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>instead of a guinea’s worth. You will still have
plenty of physicians, but we should not like
to be under their hands. While a man of
talents and character, with a liberal education
and industry, can realize a handsome and secure
income in some of your learned professions,
you cannot expect him, especially if he
have a family to provide for, and but little
private fortune, to give up a lucrative employment,
and devote himself to the labours of
political life, either gratuitously, or with an
uncertain recompense in view. He will either
keep aloof from public business, or will bestow
on it a hurried, divided, and secondary attention.
Thus, political business, and ultimately
political power, is thrown into the hands of
one or both of two classes of men:—those of
<i>large estates</i>; and <i>adventurers</i>,—men, who,
for want of character, or of steady application,
are not succeeding in any reputable and
lucrative profession, and therefore see nothing
better to do than to take their chance in the
profession—an ill-paid and precarious one, as
it seems to be among you—of politics.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many persons of both these classes, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>you, may, we doubt not, be possessed of high
qualifications; but it seems evident that with
so large a total number as you possess of educated
and intelligent gentry, you practically
limit your choice to a very small proportion
of them for persons to conduct public affairs;
and these affairs, therefore, we should expect
to find conducted, if not ill, yet by no means
so well as they might be. We should expect
to find the department of government—one
of such paramount importance—not so well
filled as many subordinate departments; and
that there would be among you a larger proportionate
number of highly qualified legal, military,
and naval men, for instance, of engineers,
artisans, &#38;c. than of statesmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are to observe,” they added, “that we
are only throwing out our <i>conjectures</i>: we are
ready and willing to stand corrected. You
must know how the matter of fact stands;
which may perhaps be at variance with our
anticipations, through the operation of some
causes we are not aware of. But we lay
before you our notions and expectations, as
the thought strikes ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>[There follows here, in the memoranda of
the travellers, the explanations they gave, in
answer to the foregoing remarks, of our institutions
and usages,—the reasons by which
they are vindicated,—and the practical working
of them. But all this, though of course
most interesting to the persons to whom it was
addressed, would probably not be so to our
readers, who must of course be familiar with
discussions relative to our own institutions and
customs, and curious rather to learn particulars
concerning those of a strange nation, however
unreasonable and whimsical their novelty may
cause them to appear. For this reason, we
have, in several other places as well as here,
omitted much that we find recorded of the
descriptions and discussions laid before the
Southlanders by their guests; inserting only
what was necessary to make their descriptions
intelligible.]</p>

<p class='c009'>Prediction Office.—Prophecies.—Useful Register.—Political
Bustlers.—Disposal of Land.—Rents.—Laws of Tenantry.—Government
Loans.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the other political curiosities, as
they may be called, which came to the knowledge
of the travellers, was a most whimsical
institution, existing in several of the states,
called a “prediction office;” viz. an establishment
consisting of two or three inspectors
and a few clerks, appointed to receive from
any one, on payment of a trifling fee, any sealed-up
<i>prediction</i>, to be opened at a time specified
by the party himself. His name is to be
signed to the prediction <i>within</i>; and on the
outer cover is inscribed the date of its delivery,
and the time when the seal is to be broken.
There is no pretence made to supernatural prophetic
powers; only, to supposed political sagacity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>At stated times, the inspectors break the
seal of those papers whose term is elapsed,
and examine the contents. In a great majority
of cases, as might be expected, these predictions
turn out either false, nugatory, or undecided:
false, if contradicted by events; nugatory,
if containing nothing but what had
been naturally and generally anticipated by
all,—like our almanacks, which foretell showers
in April, heat in summer, and cold in
winter; or undecided, when proceeding hypothetically
on some <i>condition</i> which does not
take place,—as when a man foretells that <i>if</i>
such a measure be adopted, so and so will
ensue; if then the measure is <i>not</i> adopted, the
prediction remains undecided. But here and
there a case occurs in which a man has foretold
truly something not generally expected, and
the foreseeing of which evinces, accordingly,
more or less of sagacity. In such a case he
is summoned to receive an honourable certificate
to that effect. And the travellers were
assured that some of their most eminent men,
who afterwards attained to offices of dignity and
trust, had been first called into notice from obscurity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>by means of this office. The other predictions
are kept and registered, but not made
public, except when the author of any of them
is named as a candidate for any public office.</p>

<p class='c011'>Previously to any such appointment, the inspectors
are bound to look over their register,
and produce, as a set-off against a candidate’s
claims, any unsuccessful prediction he may have
sent in. “Oh that he were here,” exclaims
Mr. Sibthorpe, “‘to write me down an ass!’
Many a man there is to whom we have committed
important public trusts, who, if such
an institution had existed among us, would
be found to have formally recorded, under the
influence of self-conceit, his own incapacity.”
He seems to consider this portion of the effects
of the plan as hardly less useful than the other,—the
establishment of the claims of some to
superior foresight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is,” he adds, “among our political
bustlers usually a great squabble when any
event takes place on the question, whether any
one, and who, may claim the honour of having
foreseen it; and ill-founded claims are often
admitted. Moreover, a prediction publicly uttered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>will often have had, or be supposed to
have had, a great share in bringing about its
own fulfilment. He who gives out, for instance,
that the people will certainly be dissatisfied
with such and such a law, is, in this,
doing his utmost to <i>make</i> them dissatisfied.
And this being the case in all unfavourable,
as well as favourable, predictions, some men
lose their deserved credit for political sagacity
through their fear of contributing to produce
the evils they apprehend; while others, again,
do contribute to evil results by their incapacity
to keep their anticipations locked up in their
own bosoms, and by their dread of not obtaining
deserved credit. For such men, this office,”
says he, “provides a relief like that which the
servant of King Midas found by telling his
secret to the hole he dug in the ground; only
there are here no whispering reeds to divulge
it.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>The mode in which the states that have considerable
tracts of uncleared land in their territory
usually dispose of these from time to time,
struck the travellers as judicious and simple.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>When, from increasing population, a demand
arises for a fresh portion of land requiring to
be cleared and brought into cultivation, each
person who desires to become a settler rents
from the state (which, as has been before observed,
is always held to be the sole proprietor
in fee-simple of its whole territory,) a suitable
allotment, at a rent which is always very
small, and often merely nominal. He obtains
a lease of this for a term of years,—commonly
twenty-one,—either at this nominal rent for
the whole term, or with a trifling increase for
the last seven or fourteen years of it. At the
end of the term, it is <i>divided</i> between him and
the state; part being made over to him in perpetuity,
(subject to the general land-tax, or government-rent,
as it is called,) and the other
part reverting to the state. The proportions
vary according as the expenses of reclaiming
the land are greater or less. If the requisite
outlay is considerable, the settler retains, perhaps,
two-thirds, or even three-fourths, of the
allotment; if the reverse, his share will be
half, or one-third. In all cases, the proportions
in which it is to be divided are a matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>express agreement previously to his first entering
on the farm. Then, in order to secure a
fair division of the land in respect of <i>quality</i>,—that
the more fertile and the poorer land, the
more and the less improved, may be duly apportioned,—recourse
is had to the obvious plan
of “one to divide and the other to choose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Suppose, for instance, the tenant is to be
entitled by his contract to one-half; then, at
the end of his term, he divides his holding into
any two portions, at his pleasure, and gives
notice to the state-surveyors, who, after due
inspection, assign one of them (whichever they
please) to him. Besides this, however, it is
very often made a separate point of special
agreement in the first instance, that, at the end
of his term, he shall have the option of obtaining,
at an advantageous rate, a lease for a
further term of the portion assigned to the
state. He is to be allowed to hold it at a rent
below the market price. No <i>definite sum</i>, however,
is fixed, and the land is offered to the
highest bidder; but the tenant who shall have
made such a contract as has been just alluded to,
is to have a certain <i>portion of his rent remitted</i>,—suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>20, 30, or 40 per cent. according to
the agreement. He is thus enabled,—supposing
all parties to agree in their calculations of
the land,—to outbid the rest. Suppose A. to
be the former tenant, and that the bidders for
the land do not offer quite so much as one
hundred pounds rent for it, and that he is
under agreement to have twenty per cent. remitted;
if he then thinks the land worth
eighty pounds, he may bid one hundred pounds,
and will be the successful competitor. But
should A. not think it worth while to pay so
much as eighty pounds, while B. is willing to
pay one hundred pounds, then B. obtains it.
Any bidder, to whom the land is knocked down,
forfeits a certain deposit in the event of his not
completing the bargain.</p>

<p class='c011'>This mode of procedure it was found necessary
to introduce on account of the great and
unexpected alterations in the value of land,
which, in a new settlement especially, may
take place by means of new towns, roads, and
other improvements. A certain <i>proportion</i> of
the market price, therefore, was fixed on, instead
of a certain <i>definite sum</i>, as a more equitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>mode of adjusting the amount of the
advantage agreed for.</p>

<p class='c011'>All rents, whether for lands or houses, and
whether from a tenant of the state or of an
individual, are payable a year <i>in advance</i>; in
other words, are payable, not for the year that
is <i>past</i>, but for the year that is to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>[The rent, in short, is like the purchase-money
of an estate, which is to be paid <i>before</i>
the title-deeds are delivered and the possession
transferred.]</p>

<p class='c011'>In like manner, with them, rent is the <i>purchase-money</i>
of the house or land <i>for one year</i>;
and the tenant has no claim upon it till that
is paid. Rent, accordingly, is not recoverable
or claimable as a <i>debt</i>; nor is there any such
thing as distraining. It is, in fact, no debt;
but at the end of the year, if the rent, or rather
purchase-money, for the <i>ensuing</i> year have not
been paid, the occupier ceases to have any interest
in the land, and is exactly in the situation
of a tenant whose lease has expired. If,
however, he has <i>agreed</i> to take the house or
land at a certain annual rent for a term of
years, and fails to fulfil the engagement, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>may be sued for a breach of contract, and,
as in the case of any other breach of contract,
will have to pay damages according to the circumstance
of the case.</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers suggested, on this being first
described, that it must be an inconvenience
to a farmer to pay a sum of money out of his
capital before he has got anything from his
land. But they learned that, to prevent this,
it is customary to let a farm for a term of
years, and to fix the rent for the <i>first</i> year
(to a new tenant) at a mere nominal sum.
“At the end of each year, therefore,” said
they, “we have our rents coming in, just as
you have in England; and if (as you say is
common in England) the same tenant and his
family continue to renew from time to time,
the landlord is just in the same situation in
both countries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is only when there is occasion to get rid
of a bad tenant, and put in a new one, that
there need be any difference; and when that
is the case, your landlord is not, by your account,
always better off than ours; but, on the
contrary, sometimes loses <i>more</i> than <i>one</i> year’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>rent, and incurs a great deal of trouble and law-expense
besides.”</p>

<p class='c011'>New settlers, becoming government-tenants
under the arrangement above described, are
sometimes in want of sufficient capital for the
requisite improvements, especially irrigation,
which is conducted on a great scale. In such
cases, the state often advances a loan at
moderate interest, secured on the land that
is to be the tenant’s portion at the end of
his term.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are no usury laws in the country;
every one lets either his land, his money, or any
other property, on whatever terms the parties
agree on.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the travellers were in conversation
with their new friends, a crowd was observed
passing through the streets, as if some circumstance
of interest had just occurred. On inquiry,
it turned out, that one of the people
had been arrested on rather an important
charge, and that the proper officers were leading
him off in custody. The travellers were
very much struck by the demeanour of the
people, which seemed to indicate respect for
the authorities, and, at the same time, a delicacy
of feeling towards the individual who was
arrested, though not yet proved guilty. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>became naturally curious to obtain information
concerning their criminal jurisprudence, their
mode of trial and of punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Adamson observed, that though any
of the company present would be competent
to detail to him the particulars of their
practice, because it was held a general duty
for every respectable person to have a knowledge
of this kind; yet that as one of their
judges, Sir Peter, was present in the room,
it would be, perhaps, more satisfactory that
they should seek the information from him.
Accordingly, on being introduced to him, they
started the subject by saying they were anxious
to know whether the Southlanders had
retained the trial by jury, as it was practised
in England. He replied, that the first settlers
had retained the usage in this respect with
which they had been familiar; but that, as
the settlement advanced, they found it expedient
to adopt some modifications of it, which
they regarded as very important. These modifications
related, he said, chiefly to the selection
of jurors, or, as they were termed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>in the settlement, syndics, and also to the degree
in which unanimity was requisite for a verdict.
“Our judges,” he said, “found speedily
that all men, even in the same rank of life,
were not equally to be entrusted with this
important function; and also, that requiring
perfect unanimity was frequently the cause,
either that no verdict was arrived at, or a
wrong one,—sometimes, even against the opinion
of the majority.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These inconveniences,” he said, “did not
develope themselves for a considerable period.
On our first settlement, when the minds of
the people were chiefly occupied in providing
for their daily wants, we found that the intelligence
of each man might be very safely
measured by the successfulness of his industry;
and we allowed our jurymen to be selected
indiscriminately from amongst those who were
able to support themselves creditably by their
own exertions. But we found, subsequently,
that successful industry was not always accompanied
by that intelligence and sagacity which
would enable men to decide on the merits of
conflicting evidence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“We have instituted, therefore, an examination
for the purpose of ascertaining fitness. As
each man becomes of age, he may, if he thinks
himself prepared, submit himself to the assembled
judges, who question him with regard to
the laws of evidence; and, if they are satisfied
both as to his intelligence and moral character,
he is marked as a person capable of discharging
this function.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The English travellers replied with a smile,
that few in England would be found, probably,
to submit themselves to such an examination;
that, though they prided themselves as a nation
upon the possession of the right to trial by
jury, yet that each man considered the office as
a burthen, which he was anxious to roll over
upon his neighbour, as interfering with the employment
of his time; and that this feeling
would certainly be strengthened if an examination
were required.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We,” said Mr. Benson, “have established
an order of syndics; and it is considered honourable
to be enrolled amongst the number.
We have conferred certain privileges on the
order; for instance, while we give to every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>man who has not been disqualified by crime
a right to one vote in the selection of parliamentary
representatives, we give three votes to each
syndic; and this in addition to the increased
number of votes which he may have arising
from the manner in which we have graduated
property. This latter circumstance has, however,
nothing to do with the matter in question.
What I wish you to remark now is, that we
regard any man of sufficient intelligence to be a
syndic, as entitled on that account to exercise
a greater influence than others in the selection
of those who are to frame our laws.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On being asked whether the examination
was really strict, Sir Peter answered that the
strictness of course varied with the dispositions
and sense of duty possessed by the existing
judges; but that rejection was a very common
occurrence. If this proceeded from moral objection,
it was exceedingly difficult for the person
to gain admission afterwards; this could
only be effected by very conspicuous and continued
good conduct. If, however, the rejection
arose from a want merely of adequate
knowledge, the individual was always at liberty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to submit himself freely for re-examination,
when in his own judgment he had acquired it.
It was not considered creditable for any syndic
to give his daughter in marriage to any one
who was not enrolled with himself in the rank
of the intelligent. Thus, he said, public opinion
has conspired with civil privileges to render
it important to each man to acquire this rank.</p>

<p class='c011'>On being asked whether the number of syndics
was considerable, he replied that it was,
and that it was found by the periodical census
that it was bearing an increasing proportion
to the number of citizens generally; that they
regarded this, in fact, as one of the tests of increasing
civilization,—more especially because
their experience proved that the examination
became more strict and enlarged, according
as the general intelligence of the country was
increased. Persons would be rejected now,
who, some years back, would have been, on
the same acquirements, sure of admission.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am describing to you, however,” he said,
“the regulations which prevail in this particular
state. In the other states in union with us,
many variations may be observed, though all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>agree in selecting syndics by examination.
The number of votes, for instance, given to
a syndic, as such, is different in different states.
Again, in some states, the number of syndics
is not left indefinite, as with us, but is limited.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Peter went on to observe, that the names
of all the syndics were regularly arranged
on rolls, each of which, in this particular state,
contained not less than one hundred and twenty
names. These rolls, a day or two before
the commencement of the assizes, were presented
to the judge, who drew from them a
certain number by lot. The persons so drawn
were then summoned to attend the court; and
when any cause was entered upon for trial,
the plaintiff and defendant were each allowed
to assign some rule according to which triers
should be taken from the roll of attendants
summoned for that day,—as, for instance, every
third or fifth or tenth individual, commencing
from the top or bottom of the list, till the
number of twelve was completed. “Thus,”
he said, “having taken precaution that none
but men of intelligence should have their
names enrolled, we must be careful that all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>packing of juries shall be out of the question.
Neither of the interested parties can influence,
either directly or indirectly, the selection of
those who have to try the case.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In those states which have a regal (or <i>quasi</i>-regal)
form of government, the sovereign has,
as with us, the privilege of pardoning criminals,
but with one exception; attempts on the life of
the sovereign himself cannot receive the royal
pardon, except through the means of an address
to the throne from the whole legislative body.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is,” say they, “very indelicate at least,
to let the king be placed in so invidious a situation
as that of having to decide on the fate of
one who assailed his life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now,” said Sir Peter, “having given you
such preliminary information as you could not
obtain by merely attending our courts, I would
propose to you to defer any further enquiries
respecting our modes of trial. These you can
best judge of by actually witnessing them for
yourselves. Come with me to-morrow: I will
take care that you shall have a convenient seat.
Observe narrowly for yourselves, and, when
the business of the day is over, put any questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>you please to me on any point in which
you perceive our customs differ from yours,
and I will explain to you our reasons for such
changes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers thankfully availed themselves
of this offer; and next morning, accordingly,
they accompanied Sir Peter to the court. Immediately
on his taking his seat, general silence
was proclaimed, when the regular officer read
from a paper the character of the suit to be
tried, the names of the parties, and of the witnesses
whom each party had summoned to give
evidence. The witnesses were then called forward,
and placed under the care of an officer,
whom they accompanied out of court. Sir
Peter whispered to the travellers, that in no
case did they permit one witness to hear the
testimony given by another.</p>

<p class='c011'>The jury were then selected in the manner
already pointed out by Mr. Benson on the previous
evening. On their taking their seats
the trial immediately proceeded; but, as the
travellers were surprised to observe, without
any administration of oaths. They remarked
also, as each witness was called, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>stated whether he was a syndic or not. In
case he was a syndic, the examination proceeded
at once; but when a witness not a
syndic was called upon, the judge urged on
him, in a brief but solemn manner, to remember,
in giving his testimony, that his thoughts
and words were known to the Searcher of
hearts.</p>

<p class='c011'>As each witness concluded his evidence, the
judge asked the opinion of the triers as to whether
that witness had shown a wish to prevaricate.
In one instance it happened that an
affirmative answer was returned, when the witness
was immediately given over to the custody
of an attending officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the evidence had been all heard, and
commented on by counsel, the names of the
twelve triers were written on slips of paper,
and four names were drawn by lot. The four
triers who answered to these names were then
separated from the rest, and the judge required
them to declare their decision within half an
hour. They were then allowed to retire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the termination of the allotted time
they returned into court, and declared that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>they were agreed. In one, however, of the
trials which subsequently took place, it happened
that, at the end of the half-hour, they
announced that the votes were divided. Four
names of the remaining triers were then selected
by lot, as before; and the judge informed
them that he would expect their decision in
twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the expiration of the time they came forward,
and pronounced a decision in favour of
the defendant. They were then called upon to
state whether, in their opinion, any witness
had given testimony which he must have known
to be false. They replied, none. The witness
charged with prevarication was then called forward,
and allowed to plead what he thought fit
in his own defence. He failed to clear himself;
and thereupon, having been very solemnly reprimanded
by the judge, was declared suspended
for a twelvemonth from exercising any vote
for a representative, or holding any civil employment
during that time.</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers remained in court, on this
and some subsequent days, to witness other
trials, and perceived that the same process was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>gone through, with such variations in the results
as might be expected. They remarked,
for instance, that one witness, who was a syndic,
was declared guilty of prevarication, and
that he was instantly pronounced to be degraded
from this office for ever; but it did
not happen during three days that the triers
denounced any witness as having been guilty of
deliberate falsehood.</p>

<p class='c011'>On joining Sir Peter in the evening of the
last day, the travellers observed to him that
they had been very much pleased with the
orderly arrangements of the court, and the
quiet attention of the spectators. “We need
scarcely,” they observed, “make any remarks
with respect to your not requiring unanimity
in your juries. The inconvenience of this requisition
has been fully acknowledged amongst
ourselves, though our practice has been suffered
to remain unchanged. We hope, indeed, that
our poet goes too far in saying that ‘wretches
hang, that jurymen may dine!’ Still, a suspicion
even that this, or, more probably, the
converse may be the case, is very injurious to
the respect which ought to be entertained for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>legal decisions. And we must admit, also, we
have heard of one juryman complaining that no
verdict was arrived at because he was associated
with eleven obstinate men who would not agree
to his opinion. We strongly suspect, therefore,
that you are justified in the change which you
have made. We would wish to know, however,
whether it does not sometimes happen
that the discrepancy of opinion, which we perceived
to have occurred on one occasion in the
first section of your jury, may not take place also
in the second, and even in the third. Amongst
us, when a discrepancy of this kind takes place,
the only remedy we have discovered is to throw
as much punishment and ridicule as we can
upon the whole jury. We lock them up for as
long a time as their constitutions can endure
without actual loss of life; and when our judge
is leaving the county, we order that the jury
shall be placed in a cart, and drawn out after
the judge to the boundaries of the district.
This certainly does not remedy the evil arising
from want of unanimity in the particular case;
but it may operate upon the minds of jurors in
other cases, and induce each of them to yield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>somewhat of his own opinion, not always to
the majority or the wisest, but to the most
stubborn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If this yielding, however,” said Sir Peter,
“proceeded, not from conviction, but from fear
of punishment and ridicule, it may be doubted
at least whether your juries are always, in point
of fact, unanimous in their verdicts. Many of
your jurors may have a strong suspicion, at
least, that the verdict should be in some respects
different from that which is actually returned.
When no verdict has been given in,
the public are aware that there was a difference
of opinion amongst the jury; but when they
do deliver a verdict, it cannot be concluded, in
every case, that there was even ultimately an
unanimity. We think it better that every man
should be left free, after having heard the opinions
of others, and consulted with them, to declare
what was his own ultimate conviction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But supposing,” the travellers said, “that
no decision is come to by the jury after the
third attempt, have you made any provision
to meet this difficulty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In that case,” said Sir Peter, “the judge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>decides, as we think he fairly might. Where the
contest is about property, we conceive it better
that a positive decision should be arrived at rather
than that the matter should be left doubtful.
We give then, however, a power of appeal
to twelve judges, who examine the evidence, and
ultimately decide. In a criminal trial we give
an absolute power of decision to the judge,
leaving him however at liberty if he pleases to
pronounce a verdict merely of Not proved; in
which case, this verdict is recorded against the
supposed culprit, as affecting his character in
case of any subsequent charge against him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We strongly suspect,” said the English travellers,
“that you are right in this part of your
practice; but,” added they with a smile, “you
have taken us by surprise in one respect; we
did not know you had adopted the opinion of
the Quakers we were describing to you,—that
oaths were forbidden by the Christian religion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have adopted their practice,” said Sir
Peter, “but not their principles. We do not
conceive oaths unlawful, but inexpedient.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers said, “We perceive you have
a substitute for oaths, as far as witnesses are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>concerned, because you make the triers pronounce
as to whether any has been in their
opinion guilty of prevarication, while his testimony
is still fresh in their recollections: and
we also observed that, when the whole trial is
over, the triers are called on to decide whether
any witness has been in their opinion guilty
of perjury. We suppose,” they observed, “that
you have a punishment when an affirmative
answer is returned?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We make the punishment,” said Mr. Benson,
“proportioned to the effect which would
have been produced by his testimony, supposing
it to have been believed true. In all cases,
of course, he forfeits office and civil privileges,
as a person unworthy of their exercise; and,
in some cases, he is fined heavily, or his property
is made to pass on to his heir, as if he himself
were dead. He may be sentenced, again,
to imprisonment and hard labour, or even to
death, should his testimony have endangered
the life of another.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We think,” said the travellers, “that this
is certainly capable of securing truth fully as
much, and even more than can be effected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>an oath; for many will shun falsehood, through
fear of detection, who would not scruple to
break an oath. But,” they said, “the decision
of your juries would appear to us more to be
relied on if that decision was given under the
sanction of an oath.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We doubt it,” said Mr. Benson, “and we
strongly suspect that you do not really differ
from us in opinion, though you do in practice;
because in the case of Quakers and others,
who are exempted from the legal necessity of
taking an oath, you are in the habit of relying
fully as much on their testimony as if they had
taken an oath. Now this does not happen, I
believe, from your thinking more highly of
Quakers than of others, but from your conviction
that oaths do not supply any real security.
To us, however, it appears that oaths
proceed altogether on an erroneous principle.
It looks as if you thought that God would not
attend to perjury, unless his attention were
specially called to the matter. And this is to
think as the savages do, who conceive their
gods are often asleep or on a journey, and
that they notice nothing except so far as they
are solicited.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“But would not your principle,” said the
English travellers, “equally militate against
prayer of any kind; because God must know
our wants, whether we supplicate him or
not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” replied the other; “he knows our
wants, but not our humble applications to him
for aid, unless we make such application. Now
it is to our prayers, not to our wants, that his
gifts are promised. He does not say ‘Need,
and ye shall have; want, and ye shall find;’
but ‘Ask, and ye shall have; seek, and ye shall
find.’ In the case of false witness, it is otherwise.
God will punish the perjurer, in another
world at least, whether he calls upon him to
do so or not. Of this every man should be reminded
whenever he is called upon solemnly
to speak truth. Your practice,” he added, “of
requiring an oath in each case, arose at that
period when it was supposed that God would
always interfere by a special judgment. You
have given this up as far as trial by single combat
is concerned; but you have retained what
grew out of the same persuasions, though, in
point of fact, you as little believe your principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>in this case as in the former. Trial by
jury, your great boast, is, as practised by you,
a remnant of the superstitious ordeal of your
barbarian ancestors. But the strangest part
of all is, that, while you require oaths, you proclaim
at the same time your belief that every
man is ready to perjure himself if he has the
smallest pecuniary interest in doing so. Thus,
for instance, you do not admit the testimony,
even on oath, of any man who may gain or
lose a shilling in consequence of his testimony.
It is not a bare suspicion that he <i>may</i> bear
false witness, and a consequent <i>abatement</i> of
confidence in his testimony, but a full confidence
that he <i>will</i> be ready to perjure himself,
and a total <i>exclusion</i> of his testimony.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again, you appear to us to think that
oaths may <i>wear out</i>; and you therefore renew
them from time to time. When a man is appointed
to some situation, you compel him to
take certain oaths. Should he continue to hold
the same situation, all is well; but if he has
so distinguished himself as to be noticed by his
superiors, and promoted to a higher office,—as,
for instance, when a clergyman is transferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>from a curacy, or from an inferior to a better
parish,—instantly he seems to fall under the
suspicion of the law, and a renewal of his oaths
is exacted from him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All this,” he said, “appears to us not only
unnecessary, but even calculated to weaken the
general sense of public duty. To require an
oath in <i>any</i> case, is to confess an expectation
that men, when not under this obligation, are
likely to tell falsehoods: to require an oath on
being invested with office, is to state that society
does not expect men to perform duties
from any sense of their importance, or any obligation
arising out of the trust reposed in the
individuals, but from a principle of a distinct
and different kind. Now, to proclaim such an
opinion, has, we think, a strong tendency to
make it true. We should apprehend, at least,
that in all cases (and, I may add, on all points)
when no oaths are required, there would be
a less active and conscientious discharge of
duties, because the only acknowledged and
legally recognised ground of obligation does
not exist; just as the oaths of witnesses tend
to produce a disregard of veracity in ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>transactions. This would be the natural result.
But, we must say, from what we have
observed of your characters, and from many
things you have mentioned to us, that you have
impressed us with the belief that much public
spirit exists amongst you in spite of your system.
We apprehend, in fact, that public opinion
amongst you is, in many respects, in advance
of your legal code. But we should like
to know your own opinion. Do you conceive,
in general, that those who hold such employments
as are guarded by oaths perform their
duties <i>in consequence</i> of the oath, or because
they conceive that integrity and due attention
are right for their own sakes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers replied they were of opinion
that most men acted from the latter feeling,
and that the oath seldom recurred to the memory
of any. “In fact,” they said, “most
persons amongst us would hold themselves affronted
if they were told that they were trusted
in any particular, not on account of their general
reputation and their own sense of rectitude,
but because they had taken an oath.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are anxious,” said Sir Peter, “that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>law should throw no obstacles in the growth
of the feelings you describe, and we therefore
exact, not only no promissory oaths, but no
promises to perform duties. Of course we allow,
and legally enforce, contracts in all cases,
when any individual consents to do something
he was otherwise not bound to, in consideration
of a promise made to him by another; as, for
instance, when he lets him land in consequence
of a stipulated rent. Promises of this kind
are committed to writing, and legally enforced.
Or, to take a more important case—marriage.
Here the parties enter upon a new course of
life, in consequence of an engagement which
each makes to the other: we enforce, therefore,
by law the fulfilment of that engagement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The English travellers asked with a smile,
“Do you always find <i>that</i> engagement fulfilled
in its spirit? Does your contract secure in
all cases mutual kindness and good temper?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” said Sir Peter, “is beyond the
reach of civil law. As far as the civil rights
of either party, or of their children, are concerned,
we enforce them by a civil contract,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>undertaken in the presence of civil magistrates.
Here the power of the law stops. But we
recommend, and public opinion sanctions our
recommendation, that every church should add
a religious ceremony; not for the purpose of
enforcing the civil obligation, for that we make
a matter of the civil law, but for the purpose of
impressing the minds of both parties with a
due sense of the moral obligations they undertake.
The forbearance and mutual kindness
essential for happiness in the marriage state
are the fruits, not of civil contract, (since they
are not of a nature to be enforced by coercion,)
but of moral principle; and our opinion is, that
this should be strengthened by whatever religious
service each church may consider most
impressive.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus, again, we have no coronation oath.
When our king dies, his heir immediately succeeds
as a matter of course, and with the full
knowledge that he is under an obligation to
govern according to the prescribed constitution.
So far our customs are like your own.
Amongst you, however, after the king has
actually entered upon his office, and not unfrequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>in some considerable time after, you
exact of him an oath. This seems to us very
like constituting two different kinds of regal
government, namely that of an uncrowned and
of a crowned king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The English travellers replied, that they regarded
the power and duty of the king as precisely
the same previously and subsequently to
his coronation oath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We know that,” said Sir Peter; “and we
therefore conclude that you yourselves do not
regard the oath as of the least importance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Punishment awarded to Criminals.—Capital Punishments.—Plea
of Insanity.—Penitentiaries.—Houses of Correction.—Improvement
in Laws.—Periodical Publications.—Editors of
Newspapers.—State of Literature.</p>

<p class='c010'>The travellers proceeded to ask some further
questions, which had been suggested to them
by what they had observed in the course of the
trials they had witnessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We perceived,” said they, “that the punishment
most frequently awarded was that of
confinement in a penitentiary; instead, however,
of naming the period of confinement, it
was generally announced that the terms of
confinement would be determined subsequently.
We wish to know the reason of this procedure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We do not,” replied Sir Peter, “in most
cases regulate the confinement by time, but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>another way. We require that each man should
perform a certain quantity of daily labour, as a
compensation—though, of course, often a very
inadequate one—for his maintenance; and
whatever he can earn above this, is placed in
a bank for him. Each man is sentenced to
earn a sum, regulated according to his trade,
state of health, and other circumstances. When
he has earned this sum, he is set at liberty.
We think this has a double advantage: it
encourages him to labour, because he is made
aware that his own industry will affect the
period of his confinement; and this has a tendency
to create in him a permanent habit of
industry. Again, the sum of money he has
earned being given to him when released, he
is not thrown on the world as a pauper, exposed
by his very destitution to fresh temptation,
but has the means of carrying on some
species of industry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have also as a punishment <i>secret</i> branding
(usually on the back), performed in the
way of tattooing, as your sailors do. Every
culprit is examined as to whether he had been
thus branded; in which case, the punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>for any subsequent crime is always the more
severe. At the same time, as the brand is
secret, the individual is not exposed on that
account to the scoffs of his neighbours, which
might make him regardless of character and
produce a hardness of disposition. These are
our most ordinary punishments.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In case of murder, however, and some few
other crimes, we resort to capital punishments.
This is restricted, as I have intimated, to very
few species of delinquency; but when those are
perpetrated, the punishment of death is rigidly
enforced and speedily inflicted. In any punishment
prompt execution adds greatly to the
terror; but in this more particularly, because
death, <i>some time or other</i>, is a sentence passed
by nature upon all men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>[Here occurs, as a marginal note to Mr. Sibthorpe’s
memoranda, a quotation from Shakspeare’s
dialogue of Pistol and Fluellin:—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Pistol.</i>—Base caitiff! <i>thou shalt die</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Fluellin.</i>—You say fery true, scald knave,
<i>when Cot’s coot pleasure is.</i>]</p>

<p class='c011'>The infliction of all punishments, including
capital, is private; that is, is in the presence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>only of certain official persons, appointed to
witness and certify the due execution of the
sentence. The travellers could not but acknowledge
the brutalising and noxiously hardening
effects of our public executions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To show you the strictness,” observed Sir
Peter, “with which our penal code is administered,
I must mention to you that we do not
allow the plea of insanity, in any case, as a
ground of acquittal, unless that insanity is of
such a nature as to warrant the opinion that
the individual did not intend to inflict the injury
for which he is tried. And in case any
degree of insanity appears to have actuated the
individual, we inquire whether this disposition
had ever been previously displayed; for in this
case we hold the relatives or friends, or persons
with whom he has lived, as accountable
for not having given the magistrates due warning
of his state of mind, so as that he should be
put into confinement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The travellers pressed in objection the various
topics commonly urged respecting greater
or lesser degrees of moral responsibility, capability
of discerning good from evil, &#38;c.; all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>which considerations the Southlanders, it appears,
are accustomed to regard as entirely irrelevant.
They maintain that criminal legislation
has nothing whatsoever to do with moral
retribution; the sole object of human laws being
the prevention of crime, which can take
place in all those cases, and in those only, where
the intention of the agent (no matter how that
intention originates) is directed towards the
action to be prevented.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the travellers expressing a strong desire
to see their penitentiary, and examine its system
of management; “We have many penitentiaries,”
said Sir Peter, “and in each of
them the system adopted differs in some respects
from that of others; for we hold it to
be a subject of constant experiment to ascertain
what mode of discipline may be the best
fitted to secure the ultimate object at which we
aim, which is, as I have just said, not the infliction
of vengeance on the guilty, but the prevention
of crime. I shall enable you, however,
to judge of our system in this respect by taking
you to visit our penitentiaries, according as you
can command leisure.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“The systems pursued in some of our houses
of correction,” he added, “need, and, I trust,
will receive alteration; but I hope you will
not think me unduly partial in considering the
very worst of our modes of secondary punishment
far preferable to yours. Be assured we
shall never undertake to found a new nation
from the sweepings of our jails; receiving additional
corruption—those of them who are capable
of it—by unrestricted intercourse with
each other during a four months’ voyage, and
their moral degradation completed by being
reduced to a state of slavery; that is, by being
consigned, as in your colony, to masters for
whose benefit they are compelled to labour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>[The manuscript of the travellers did not
contain very full information on the subject of
penitentiaries, as there were many which they
were still designing to visit. It would appear,
however, that in some penitentiaries solitary
confinement was the practice; in others, the
culprits worked in companies; but, as in some
of the American penitentiaries, total silence
was enforced. Every man was made to work
in a mask, in order that he should remain unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>to the rest, and thus escape the hardening
effects which are the consequences of exposure
of character.]</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is one part of our system,” said Sir
Peter, “which I should mention to you, because
it will serve to show you the diligence
with which we apply ourselves to the continual
improvement both of our civil and penal code.
We hold it as a duty belonging to our judges
and chief law officers, that they should discuss
amongst themselves, from time to time, whatever
alteration their experience in the administration
of our laws may suggest to any of
them as desirable. Whatever report is sent
in by their united wisdom to parliament, is received
with the utmost deference; and should
any doubt remain as to the expediency of
adopting their proposal, we invite some of the
judges or law officers to assist us in our deliberations,
by stating publicly the grounds of their
recommendation. We allow them to debate
freely, as if they were members of parliament;
but of course we do not give them, as they are
not members, any vote in the final decision.
Indeed,” he observed, “whenever we appoint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>(as we very constantly do) a commission empowered
to collect information on any particular
subject, and draw up a report recommending
any new laws or practices, we allow
the members of that commission to attend our
parliamentary meetings and explain their own
reasons. We conceive this can be best done
by the same individuals whom we appoint to
deliberate. We regard them as members of
parliament in fact, <i>pro hac vice</i>, except that
we do not give them a power of voting.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>Newspapers, magazines, and other periodical
publications are abundant and cheap in this
country.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the early part of the traveller’s visit, Lieutenant
R. Smith, having accidentally taken up
a newspaper which lay on the table, was much
interested in its perusal. The leading articles
appeared to have been written with considerable
discretion and good sense. He asked whether
he might regard that paper as a fair specimen
of the degree of talent which their newspapers
generally presented.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>The gentleman of the house replied that, in
his estimation, that paper was rather the best
of the day. Its conductor was a person of very
high character and great attainments.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You just saw him,” he said, “riding by
with our leading minister. We have several papers,—besides
magazines and other periodicals,—conducted
also with various degrees of talent,
and of every shade and variety of political sentiment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In our country,” said Lieutenant Smith,
“conductors are not on such familiar terms
with our statesmen; indeed they are seldom
to be met in cultivated society. We think it
the lowest department of literature. In fact,
we scarcely deem the editor of a newspaper
a literary man, or even a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose then,” said Mr. Bruce (their host),
“that your papers are nothing more than a
record of events and advertisements; and that
they exercise no influence upon the general
sentiments of the country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite the reverse,” said the English travellers.
“The newspapers produce a very decided
influence; so much so that each party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>in the state takes care to hold some of them in
pay, as advocates of the opinions which that
party is anxious to maintain: and the editor
of a paper not unfrequently prescribes the opinions
or conduct which each party should
adopt, many confining their reading almost exclusively
to papers on their own side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is very strange to us,” said Mr. Sibthorpe,
“and it appears perfectly inconsistent.
Your refusal to associate with the conductors
as gentlemen of reputation, must make them
unworthy to be received into good society;
most emphatically and particularly unworthy,
not merely as unfitted for the company of gentry,
but as undeserving of the respect of reputable
people. Such, at least, seems to us to be
the tendency of a ban of exclusion fixed on a
class of persons such as these writers. A small
shopkeeper indeed, or mechanic, though not
admitted into the social circles of the higher
classes, may be a worthy and respectable man
in his way, and may well be content to associate
with those who are in every respect his
own equals; but not so a man of such education,
knowledge, and talent as are requisite for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the successful conduct of a newspaper. A man
so qualified will seldom, we should think, be
found consenting to follow an employment which
excludes him from the society of gentlemen,
unless there be, in some way or other, something
of moral inferiority about him. Exceptions
there may be; but we should fully expect
this to be at least the general rule. We take
care, therefore, since newspapers cannot but
influence public opinion, to induce men of reputation
to engage in this department, by showing
that we regard it as a most honourable employment.
To act otherwise, would seem to
us like proclaiming that we were determined
to be rogue-led.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The English travellers asked if the newspapers
had to pay a tax to the state. They were
informed, that in this particular state no tax
was exacted, but that in other states of the
union the practice was different. “We observe,”
said they, “a vast number of advertisements
of all kinds; and, amongst the rest, that a great
variety of books were announced as in the
press.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our press,” said one of the company, “is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>very active; but you can best judge of the state
of our literature by examining hereafter our
public libraries. To some of these we shall
have great pleasure in conducting you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The most ancient, and, at present, the largest
university is in the state of Müllersfield. Mr.
Sibthorpe’s notes on this subject contain but
a small portion of the little he had, up to that
time, been enabled to collect; as it happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>that the principal vacation of all the universities
is in the spring, the time of the travellers’
arrival in the country. He was, accordingly,
promising himself, in the latter part of
his sojourn, to obtain a much fuller and more
correct acquaintance with their academical institutions.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears that, as might have been expected,
the Southlanders have not made the same
advancements in the physical sciences as the
Europeans, though much greater than, under
their circumstances of seclusion, could have
been anticipated. They have detected and rectified
the error of the Julian calendar. The
alteration of their style, which was begun above
a century and a half ago, was not established at
once, like the reform first made in Roman Catholic,
and subsequently in Protestant countries;
but was effected <i>gradually</i>, by the simple omission
of the leap-years, till the error was rectified.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Sibthorpe was particularly struck with
the circumstance, that, both at the universities
and elsewhere, the <i>art of teaching</i> is distinctly
taught as a separate and most important department;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>regular lectures on it being given,
and the pupils exercised in various modes, to
train and qualify them for the office of giving
instruction to others. This people are so far
from taking for granted—as, till of late years,
has been commonly done in Europe—that every
one is qualified to teach anything he knows
himself, that, from the highest to the lowest
description of schoolmaster or tutor, every one
is required to have gone through a regular
course of training for that profession. Nor is
the study of this art by any means confined
to those who design professionally to engage
in it; but some degree of it is considered as
a part of a liberal education.</p>

<p class='c011'>In some of the newly-settled, and, consequently,
thinly-peopled districts, there are sometimes
two (and, in some instances, even three)
schoolhouses for one master or mistress. In
such a case, the master attends at them by
turns for half a week, or, if at a greater distance,
a week. Sometimes the schools are kept
up during the intervals by an assistant; sometimes
even this is wanting; and the children
remain at home half their time preparing lessons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>in which they are examined when they
return to school. It is held that one good
master can do more service in two or three
schools than two or three inferior ones. All
parents and guardians are required to have the
children under their care instructed. Any who
may be too poor to afford the moderate cost of
the humblest education are provided with it
at the public charge; but it is very rare indeed
that there is occasion for this, except in
the case of the half-reclaimed aborigines.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Southlanders were astonished to hear
that, in what is called civilized Europe, a large
proportion of the population should remain totally
illiterate, “<i>like the savages</i>.” When they
were told that some persons in England dreaded
the education of the labouring classes, as unfitting
them for their station, and were disposed
to apply the remark of Mandeville, that “if a
horse knew as much as a man, I should be
sorry to be his rider,” they inquired how this
was to be reconciled with the <i>political rights</i>
which they were told were conceded to these
very people; and how it could be safe to entrust
<i>power</i> to those whom it was thought unsafe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>to instruct how to make a <i>rational use</i>
of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If,” said they, “you are to keep men in
slavery, like the domestic brutes, it may be the
safest way to keep them in as brutish a condition
of mind as you can; but brutes that are
<i>not</i> enslaved are much more dangerous animals
than rational beings. A horse is kept as a
slave, and, however gently treated, is subjected
to restraint, and compelled to labour for his
<i>master’s</i> service. It would be doubtless unsafe,
and, what is more, <i>unjust</i>, to ride a horse if
he <i>knew as much</i> as a man,—<i>i. e.</i> if he were a
rational being, instead of a brute; but Dr.
Mandeville ought to have remembered that,
if a groom <i>knew no more</i> than a horse, he would
be very unfit to be a <i>rider</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They require, accordingly, that any parent
who, from inconvenient distance of residence or
any other cause, is unable or unwilling to send
a child to school, shall provide for his instruction
at home, and shall bring him to the periodical
examinations of the school inspectors,
who are appointed to visit the schools at stated
times and examine the children. On being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>asked what would be done in the case of any
parent’s refusing instruction to his children,
they said that no such case had occurred in
their recollection; but that they conceived, if
it should occur, it would be considered as a
sufficient evidence of mental derangement. As
for the <i>right</i> of a parent over his children, they
utterly denied that his children <i>belong</i> to him
in the same manner that dogs and cats and
horses do, which he is at liberty to keep as
mere pets and playthings, or as drudges, or
to sell or drown if he finds himself overstocked.
They hold that he has no more right to
debar his children from instruction than to
deny them proper food and clothing. To these
last they have a fair claim—a claim enforced
by law in all countries—as <i>animals</i>; to the
other, as <i>rational</i> beings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Female education also they attend to quite
as much as Europeans, without confining it so
much (among the upper classes) to mere showy
accomplishments. Some of them laughed at
our employment of the word “accomplishment,”
“which,” said they, “signifies properly
a <i>completion</i> of that which, by your account, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>never <i>begun</i>.” They cited a maxim which,
they said, had been laid down by Aristotle,—that
a people whose institutions pay no regard
to women and children, are neglecting the <i>half</i>
of the <i>present</i> generation, and the <i>whole</i> of the
<i>next</i>. And they observed, that a child whose
earliest years,—whose first impressions, and habits
of thought and sentiments,—have been left
to a mother who is wanting in cultivated understanding,
and sound principles, and well-regulated
feelings, will be very far from having
a fair chance of turning out an estimable member
of society.</p>

<p class='c011'>On these subjects the travellers had much
conversation with Sir Andrew Knox, who holds
in the kingdom of Eutopia the office of inspector-general
of education, nearly answering to
that of minister of public instruction in some of
the European states. In his observations on
the conduct of the governments of Europe,—such
as they had been three centuries back,
and such as many of them appeared to him
to continue in some measure still unchanged,—he
remarked that nothing could be more completely
the reverse of a wise and honest legislature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>than the attempt to make <i>belief</i> compulsory,
and <i>knowledge not</i> compulsory.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They enforced,” said he, “the reception of
‘true religion,’—that is, what the rulers regarded
as such; and left it optional to learn, or to
remain ignorant of, the difference between one
religion and another. Even you, it seems, regard
it as an intolerable encroachment on liberty to
compel a person to learn his letters that he may
be able to <i>read</i> the Bible; but you compel him
to <i>believe</i> the Bible,—at least to profess his belief,
or not openly to deny it. His <i>knowledge</i>
of the book may be anything or nothing, just
as he pleases; but he is required to acknowledge
its divine authority and the correctness
of your interpretation of it, or else you treat
him as a helot or an alien, and exclude him
from civil rights and power. He is not obliged
to know whether Jerusalem is in the northern
or southern hemisphere, or whether Mahomet
lived before or after Christ; but he <i>is</i> obliged,
under pain of punishments or civil disabilities,
to think with you as to the Jewish, Christian,
and Mahometan religions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now this,” he continued, “does seem to us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>most preposterous. I am not adverting now to
its opposition to the principles of justice or of
the Christian religion, but to common sense. An
injunction which it is completely <i>in the power</i>
of the subject to obey, and of the government
to enforce, this governments do <i>not</i> issue; and
one which the subject may be <i>unable</i> to obey,
and which the government <i>cannot</i> fully enforce,
<i>that</i> forms an essential part of their enactments;
for to acquire a certain humble degree
of <i>knowledge</i> (when government provides the
means of instruction) is a command which the
subject is clearly <i>able</i> to obey. He may, indeed,
not think knowledge worth the trouble of
study, and may be so brutish as to feel it a
hardship not to be allowed to remain in stupid
ignorance; but, unless he is a born idiot, he
cannot say that it is <i>out of his power</i> to learn
anything, or, again, that it is <i>against his conscience</i>
to attempt it; nor, on the other hand,
can he evade the requisition by <i>pretending</i> to
have learnt what he has not, since his proficiency
may be ascertained by examination.
In the other case, <i>all</i> these circumstances are
reversed. A man may be really <i>unable</i> to adopt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the same view of religious truth as his rulers;
he may feel it a <i>violence to his conscience</i> to
profess their belief; and, lastly, he can always,
if conscience does not stand in his way, make a
false and hypocritical profession of a faith which
he does not really hold.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These governments, therefore, do <i>not</i> interfere
where their interference would be, at
least, both allowable and effectual—<i>we</i> think
beneficial; and where their interference, as we
think, is always noxious, but evidently may be
both unjust and ineffectual, there they do interfere.
Such a ruler, if he teaches his subjects
hypocrisy, teaches them at least to be like himself;
for his pretended zeal for God’s honour
and his people’s welfare must be a mere specious
cloak for his desire to uphold his own
power in the most effectual and least troublesome
way. As for true religion, if he had the
least particle of it, or the least conception of its
nature, he could not but know that it is a
thing which cannot be enforced by law.”</p>

<p class='c011'>[Much more to the same purpose was urged
by Sir Andrew Knox, who, like most of his
countrymen, is tinged, as our readers will have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>perceived, with much of that peculiar habit of
thought, derived from the founders of the colony,
which many will probably be disposed to
regard as eccentric enthusiasm and extravagance.
The travellers laid before him, in reply,
the arguments commonly employed in Europe
(which need not be here repeated) for and
against the existing principles of legislation,
and the various modifications of these which
have been introduced in the several European
states.]</p>

<p class='c011'>On something being said respecting the duty
of a Christian ruler to maintain and enforce
true religion, and respecting the conduct to be
pursued by a Christian community, Sir Andrew
observed that, in former times, there appeared
to have prevailed among their European
ancestors much confusion of thought on those
subjects, which did not seem to be even now
cleared up, but to be fostered by indistinctness
of language.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ours,” said he, “are ‘Christian states,’ in
the sense that the <i>individual citizens</i> of them
are Christians, but not in the sense of our <i>laws
enforcing</i> the profession of Christianity, or of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>any particular religious persuasion. And although,
in the sense first specified, our states
might be called Christian, the phrase ‘Christian
community’ conveys to <i>our</i> minds the idea, not
of a state, but of a <i>church</i>; and to blend the
two kinds of community into one, so as to give
spiritual jurisdiction to the civil magistrate, to
maintain religion by secular coercion, and to
give those of a particular creed a monopoly of
civil privileges and secular offices,—this we
consider as changing Christianity into Judaism,
and making Christ’s kingdom one ‘of this
world,’ which he expressly forbade.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But is it not natural, Sir Andrew,” said
Mr. Sibthorpe, “that Christians, who have any
real veneration for their religion, should wish to
exclude from all share of political power in a
Christian nation those who are not Christians,
or who have depraved and corrupted the Christian
faith?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing could be more <i>natural</i>,” replied
he, “than that the Jewish people, when convinced,
as the mass of them at one time were,
of his divine mission, should wish to take Jesus
and force Him to be their king, so that all who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>should have disowned his authority, or disobeyed
his commands, would have incurred the penalties
of treason. Nothing, I say, could be more
natural than this; and thence it is that He was
so earnest in renouncing all such pretensions,
and prohibiting all such attempts: and experience
shows how consonant to the character
of the ‘natural man’ such a course of procedure
has been ever since.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the question is not what is agreeable
to human nature, but to the divine will. Our
Master declared that his kingdom is not a temporal
one; and we must not seek to do Him
honour by running counter to his commands, so
as to <i>make</i> it a kingdom of this world, and, as
it were, ‘take Him by force to make Him a
king.’ It cannot evince our veneration for
Him to mix up religion with politics, when He
and his Apostles neither did so nor permitted
their followers to do so, though <i>they</i> possessed
(what no human rulers can with truth pretend
to) one ground of a claim to the right of enforcing
true religion by civil penalties and disabilities,
viz. the infallible knowledge of what
<i>is</i> true religion.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“As for what you were saying of Christ’s
kingdom being indeed not of this world, but
that, according to prophecy, the kingdoms of
the earth are to become the kingdoms of the
Lord, this we conceive must be understood of
the <i>people themselves</i> becoming Christians; because
we conceive that, if it were understood as
authorising the state, as a civil community, to
enforce and regulate Christianity by the secular
sword, then Christ’s kingdom <i>does</i> become
a kingdom of this world. To set up a plea
founded on a subtle verbal distinction where
there is no real difference, reminds one (if I
may be pardoned for using so homely an illustration)
of the quibbling thief, who contended
that he was unjustly charged with having carried
off a horse; for that, in truth, it was the
horse that had carried off him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Jesuits of whom you have been telling
me, according to the worst accounts given of
their tricks and subterfuges, evasions and mental
reservations, would be well deserving of their
title,—they would be really and fitly ‘companions
of Jesus,’—if we could suppose Him and
his Apostles to have secretly maintained a principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>which goes to nullify practically (as soon
as their followers should have gained sufficient
strength) all their disavowals of political designs,—all
their renunciation of temporal power
as connected with their religion,—all desire
to monopolize, as Christians, civil ascendency.
They were accused of forbidding to give tribute
to Cæsar,—of speaking against Cæsar, &#38;c.
Now, if you suppose that, when Jesus, in answer
to such charges, said in a loud voice to the Roman
governor, ‘My kingdom is not of this world,’
He had <i>whispered</i> to his disciples, ‘This is only
till you have gained sufficient numbers and
strength; whenever and wherever you can become
the predominant party, then draw the
sword which I lately bid you sheathe, and enforce
by civil penalties submission to my laws,
and exclude by law from political privileges all
who will not join your communion:’—if you
suppose that while He publicly issued the injunction,
‘Render to Cæsar the things that are
Cæsar’s,’ He added, as it were <i>aside</i>, to his companions,
“Remember, however, that, as Cæsar
is an idolater, you must hereafter make him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>embrace Christianity on pain of ceasing to be
Cæsar; you must oblige him and all other governors
and public officers, from the highest to
the lowest, and all who would lay claim to any
of the rights of citizens in any state where you
can acquire political ascendency, to profess my
religion; and <i>then</i> you must render to Cæsar
the things that are Cæsar’s; you must then
‘render unto all their due,’ after having first
secured that none but those who agree with
you in religion shall <i>have</i>, politically, <i>any</i> due
at all; you must ‘submit yourselves to every
ordinance of man,’ after having first provided
that every ordinance of man shall have submitted
to you; you must consider ‘the powers
that be’ as ‘ordained of God,’ after having
monopolized them all for yourselves, carefully
excluding unbelievers:—if, I say, you suppose
this to have been the secret meaning, and
these the private instructions, of Jesus and his
Apostles, while their openly avowed teaching
was such as we find recorded, well surely may
the most disingenuous of the <i>Jesuits</i> lay claim
to their title.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Can an unbeliever, then,” said Mr. Sibthorpe,—“can
even an atheist, in this country,
rise to the highest offices?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope,” said Sir Andrew, “such instances
are rare; I know of none: but if you speak of
the <i>possibility</i>, you should remember that in
<i>every</i> country, even where the Inquisition exists,
an atheist can, by disguising his real opinions,
rise to any office, even that of Grand
Inquisitor, or of Pope; which, indeed, you were
lately telling me is suspected to be no such
very rare occurrence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” said Mr. Sibthorpe; “there is no
law that can prevent hypocrisy; but what I
meant is, an open and <i>avowed</i> infidel, or an advocate
of extravagant corruptions of religion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean to ask,” said Sir Andrew,
“whether <i>I would vote for</i> a man of that description,
and whether a majority of electors
would in any case be as likely to appoint him
as one of opposite character, I answer at once
in the negative; but if you are asking whether
there is any <i>law to prohibit</i> my voting for such a
man,—any <i>legal</i> incapacity on religious grounds,—we
have no such law. As far as a man’s religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>opinions are concerned, his fitness or
unfitness for any civil office is left to be decided
by the judgment of the <i>electors</i>. Conviction of
any <i>crime</i>, or ascertained deficiency in the requisite
<i>knowledge</i>, alone disqualify a man by
law for public offices.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is important,” added he, “to keep
distinct two questions which, I observe, the modern
Europeans, as well as our ancestors, have
often confounded,—the question whether a person
of such and such a description is or is not
<i>fit</i>, or the most fit, to be appointed to such and
such an office; and the question, whether the
<i>electors</i> to that office shall be left to decide that
point according to <i>their</i> judgment, instead of
the legislators deciding it for them, and restricting
their choice. How much shall be <i>left to the
discretion</i> of the electors is one question; what
is the wisest and <i>best use</i> they can make of
their discretion is another, quite different,
though often confounded with it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, among us, it is in a <i>religious</i>, not a
<i>civil</i> community—in a <i>church</i>, not in a <i>state</i>—that
a man’s religious qualifications or disqualifications
are taken notice of in the laws of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>community as determining whether he may or
may not be one of its officers or one of its members.
Our brethren in Europe, you seem to
think, would, some of them, take for granted,
from our acting on these principles, that we
must be very indifferent about religion (though
you, I rejoice to find, are ready to bear your
testimony to the contrary); but they might as
well conclude that we are indifferent about
political affairs also, because we attend places of
worship in which no political questions are discussed,
and are members of Christian churches
which do not intermeddle with politics. Indeed,
I myself, as well as many others, am a
member of an agricultural association also, in
which neither political nor religious matters
are introduced; and yet I hope many of us
are good citizens, good Christians, and good
farmers too.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But since your people hold it to be allowable
and right, and a duty, for a civil legislature
in a Christian country to take cognizance of
matters of religious faith, (which <i>we</i> think should
be left between each man’s conscience and the
Deity,) you ought, methinks, to see nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>incongruous neither in a religious community
taking cognizance of political matters also, and
embodying in its creed and formularies decisions,
not only of points of faith, but of points
of politics. Thus you would have, not only Trinitarian
or Arian churches, Calvinistic or Arminian,
Episcopalian or Presbyterian churches,
&#38;c. but also, according to your phraseology,
Tory churches and Whig churches, commercial-restriction
churches and free-trade churches,
&#38;c. Parents, bringing their child to be baptized,
would have to engage that he should
be brought up in sound political as well as
sound religious views; and to renounce in his
name, not only sin, the world, and the devil,
but also annual parliaments and vote by ballot,
or some other political measure; and would
have to be solemnly admonished, not only to
bring him at a suitable age to be confirmed
by the bishop, but also to have his vote duly
registered. And a man would not be admissible
at the eucharist unless he first declared
his opinion, not only on the question of transubstantiation,
but also on the mint regulations,
paper currency, or any other such points on which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the church or sect he belonged to should determine
what was to be accounted orthodox. If
you are struck, as you seem to be, with the incongruity
and absurdity of such regulations and
practices as these, you may form some conception
how incongruous it appears in <i>our</i> eyes
to mix up together <i>at all</i> the Christian religion
and politics. In short,” he added, in conclusion,
“do but consider whether, among you,
religion is considered as <i>a part of politics</i>, or
<i>politics a part of religion</i>. If neither (which is
what <i>we</i> hold), then your conduct is palpably
inconsistent with your principles. If you hold
religion to be a part of politics, what becomes
of your <i>Christianity</i>? But if politics is held
to be a part of religion, then such politico-religious
creeds and formularies as I have just
now been supposing, must be, not only reasonable,
but even necessary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I admit,” said Mr. Sibthorpe, “the absurdity
of attempting by secular penalties to produce
conviction of a religious doctrine, and the
cruelty, as well as absurdity, of compelling outward
profession of conviction. But how do
you proceed in regard to the public <i>promulgators</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of pernicious error? Is not a government
bound to protect its subjects, not only
from theft and violence, but also from having
their minds, especially those of the young, the
weak, and the ignorant, corrupted by every one
who chooses to go about scattering moral and
spiritual poison around him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No one,” answered Sir Andrew Knox,
“would be allowed among us, under the plea
of conscience, or any other, to incite men to
a violation of the laws, to a breach of the
peace, or to rebellion against government;
else, indeed, men might be found preaching
up theft and all sorts of crimes, like those Anabaptist
sects that appeared before we left Europe,
who inculcated community of goods and
of wives, and I know not what abominations
besides.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the practice, or the recommendation,
of anything that is immoral, and so accounted
by <i>all</i> good men of whatever religious persuasion,
is clearly punishable by the civil magistrate.
Nor can any plea of conscience be admitted
as justifying abusive language against
any class of religionists,—threats, violence, personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>slander, or interruption of religious worship.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if any man peaceably sets forth his own
views respecting religion, appealing to men’s
reason and conscience and the visible universe,
or the Scriptures, we do not hold that the civil
authorities are justified in going about to punish
or silence him, or in excluding him from civil
rights. Any <i>church</i>, indeed, to which he may
have belonged will disown him as a member
if he teach anything at variance with their fundamental
religious principles; but this we do
not regard as a <i>punishment</i> inflicted as for an
offence, but rather as a <i>dissolution of partnership</i>
between two parties who cannot agree as
to the matter in which they were partners.
He is excommunicated by his church only in
the same manner as his church is excommunicated
by him; but no <i>secular penalties</i> or
privations are incurred by imputed religious
error.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For we consider that, in the first place, as
the legislature is not infallible, there is no security
that its enactments may not be on the
wrong side; as there have been, indeed, both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Trinitarian and Arian, Protestant and Popish
laws and rulers: and, secondly, we consider
that Christ and his Apostles, who did possess
infallibility, deliberately chose to rest their cause
on pure persuasion alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But might it not be urged,” said Mr. Sibthorpe,
“that this would go to put an end to <i>all</i>
legislation on all subjects, since no legislature
can be infallible, even in political measures?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is true,” replied Sir Andrew, “that
statesmen can lay no claim to infallible wisdom,
even in their own department; and there is,
accordingly, no country whose laws are, or <i>need
be believed to be</i>, perfect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the duty of a good citizen to labour
to bring about the improvement of any laws
which he thinks inexpedient; but in the mean
time (and <i>here</i> lies the important difference) he
may, in almost all cases, obey the laws <i>with a
safe conscience</i>, even such as he may not approve
of; because they require only the <i>outward
acts</i> of compliance, and not the inward
assent and conviction of the mind. You had,
for instance, formerly a law enjoining all men
to put out their fires at the toll of the curfew-bell;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>it is now long since repealed. You had
a law against selling game, which you have
told us is abrogated. These laws may have
been very inconvenient; but it could not be
against a man’s conscience to put out his fire
or to abstain from buying and selling game,
though it <i>would</i> have been to require him to
declare his <i>belief</i> in the wisdom of those regulations.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hence it is that, imperfect as human legislation
must be, laws, since they are essential to
the existence of civil society, have the sanction
of reason, and conscience, and Scripture in favour
of submission to them, except in those
cases where submission involves a violation of
some prior duty; as if, suppose, we had a law
enjoining us to hunt down the blacks, and kill
them like wild beasts. But it is remarkable
that almost all the cases where it does become
a duty to resist the law, are those in which
<i>religion</i> is concerned,—those, in short, in which
the civil legislature has gone out of its own
province; as when a man is required to profess
or renounce, to preach or abstain from preaching,
a certain religion; forbidden to instruct a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>slave in Christianity, (as, you say, was formerly
the law at the Cape of Good Hope,) and other
such injunctions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On these grounds,” continued he, “we hold
that all interference of the secular power to enforce
the profession of ‘true religion’ and punish
‘heretics,’ or to give Christians, or any
particular description of Christians, political ascendency
on religious grounds, are adverse to
the spirit and injurious to the cause of true religion,
contrary to the commands of its Author,
tending to impair the force of its proper evidence,
and leading at once to oppression in one
party, to hypocrisy in the other, and to unchristian
rancour in both.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These principles may be said, in some sort,
to form a part of our national creed; for there
is no one of our churches that does not maintain
them, and inculcate the strictly voluntary
character of true Christianity, and the spiritual,
and not secular nature, of its Author’s kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what would you do,” said Mr. Sibthorpe,
“if some church were to arise among
you of opposite principles? Would you tolerate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>a sect whose religion forbade them to tolerate
others?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” said the other, “is certainly a
shrewd question, and one which, I am happy
to say, we can none of us answer from experience;
as we have never had, and I hope never
shall have, any such among us. I can, therefore,
only speak from conjecture as to what
conclusions we might come to in such a case.
Probably, a good deal might depend on the
<i>actual temper</i> of the persons who should hold
in theory persecuting principles; for as men
are too often worse than their principles, so,
as you must be well aware, they are sometimes
better; and if men of such principles
were content to let their right and duty of
persecution remain by some humane subterfuge
in abeyance and dormant, we should
probably let them alone. Much might also
depend on their strength of numbers, on their
power, as well as their disposition to do mischief.
The cat appears to be much the same
kind of animal as the lions and tigers we have
read of; but, being too small to be formidable,
is allowed to go loose about the house. I suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>it would be unsafe to extend the same
<i>toleration</i> to a tiger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But on one point I think I can answer you,
though still from conjecture, pretty confidently:
if there <i>should</i> be any sect or class of men
in one of our states whom we found it impossible
to place, with due regard to our safety, on
the footing of citizens, we should undoubtedly
<i>part company</i>; we should banish them all, or
we should imprison them all; nay, I think we
should even put them all to death at once,
were there no better alternative, rather than
tolerate among us a race of helots or Gibeonites,—a
degraded and disfranchised caste, especially
one degraded on account of religious
differences. <i>That</i> is contrary to all the principles,
political and religious, which we have
imbibed, as it were, with our very mothers’
milk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is, however, one point in which you
were remarking, the other day, that our practice
is more rigid than yours, and in which we
might perhaps appear at the first glance to be,
though in truth we are not, acting at variance
with these principles. You were remarking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>that we are more prompt and daring than
most Europeans in placing under restraint
those who appear to be in a state of dangerous
mental derangement. We hold it to be a benefit
to the individual, as well as to the community,
to confine and keep in order one who
is palpably incapable of taking due care of himself;
as, for instance, an habitual drunkard,
who, though not otherwise mad, when sober
cannot command himself so as to refrain from
drinking, when liquor is within his reach, till
he becomes no better than mad. Now, although
no legal interference takes place to
prevent a man from setting forth his own views
of religion, or any other subject, and <i>appealing
to the judgment</i> of his hearers, it is otherwise
if he profess to have received a <i>divine revelation</i>
and to be the bearer of an immediate message
from the Deity. We do not pronounce such
pretensions a <i>crime</i>; for the magistrate has no
right to prejudge the question as to their <i>truth</i>,
nor, for the same reason, are they considered
as decisive evidence of insanity: but they do
justify a certain degree of suspicion of it, and
of such an insanity as may prove highly mischievous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>in various ways; and especially as
being, above all other kinds of insanity, dreadfully
infectious. Madmen of this particular
class are, among persons of a nervous and
excitable temperament, almost as dangerous
as mad dogs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, any person professing, as the Apostles
did, to have received an immediate divine commission
to be special messengers of God, sent
forth by his miraculous interposition with prophetic
inspiration, must be either <i>a true apostle</i>,
or an impious <i>impostor</i>, or else a man under
<i>mental alienation</i>. That there can be but these
three possible suppositions is evident; though it
may not be evident, in any given case, <i>which</i> of
the three is the true one. On the first supposition,
the man is evidently entitled, <i>as soon as
he shall have exhibited his credentials</i>, by displaying
such miracles as are the ‘signs of an
apostle,’ to high veneration, and diligent attention
to what he is commissioned to declare.
On the second supposition, he ought to be
punished, on the same principle (only more
severely) as pretended witches, conjurors, and
other such cheats who practise on the credulity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of the superstitious. On the third supposition,
the man ought to be secluded and taken care
of, and subjected to proper treatment for the
cure of his disorder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In all cases, then, of professed inspiration
and immediate divine commission, our laws enjoin
solitary confinement, as perfectly suitable
on any of the foregoing three suppositions.
The person is subjected to no indignity or
unnecessary pain; he is treated tenderly, and
carefully provided for; but he is closely secluded
from all but medical attendants and
other official persons. We have a full trust
that, if he be indeed a divine messenger, he
will be miraculously liberated. We find in
Scripture that this <i>was</i> done repeatedly; as in
the case of the first imprisonment of the Apostles,—in
that of Peter alone, afterwards,—and
that of Paul and Silas. They were thus enabled
both to execute their commission, and,
by appeal to the miracle, to attest its truth.
Nor do we consider that, as long as we abstain
from all reproach or unnecessary violence, we
should be doing any wrong even to real prophets,
or presumptuously tempting the Deity;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>for it is contrary to all reason, and to all Scripture,
to suppose that He ever did or can require
implicit faith to be given to his ambassadors
without furnishing them with testimonials;
with credentials, to satisfy us that they really
are sent by Him. To call upon a man pretending
to inspiration to display a sensible
miracle (as by a supernatural release from confinement)
is no affront to God or man; it is
only asking a professed ambassador for his credentials.
But if, again, the man be either an
impious impostor, or a lunatic, his confinement
is, in the one case, a just, though very mild
punishment, or, in the other, an act of kindness
towards himself, as well as a removal of
a nuisance to the public.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Instances of the first class, I need hardly
tell you, have not occurred; and there are not
many of us, I believe, who expect that they
ever will. But whatever may be thought of
that last question, we all agree that it would
imply want of faith, ignorance of Scripture, and
folly, to doubt that God, if He did send us
an inspired messenger, would fail to vindicate
His own honour, and establish the prophet’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>mission, by miraculous proof; or to suspect
that it could be displeasing to Him that we
should insist on such proof, and refuse to incur
the risk of <i>idolatry</i> in paying divine homage
to a human device or delusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In respect of the second class—impostors,
our law has operated chiefly (as might have
been expected) in the way of prevention. In
a few instances, however, such men (having,
for the most part, <i>secretly</i> circulated their pretensions
among the credulous) have been induced,
by the correction thus administered, to
confess their fraud, and submit to the penalties
of the laws enacted against common cheats.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of the third class—those under delusion,
there have been a good many instances; and,
in a large proportion of them, quiet seclusion
and proper medical treatment have effected the
restoration of reason: but some cases, as in all
other kinds of derangement, prove incurable.
There are also, by your account, in Europe also,
such patients in almost every lunatic asylum,—imaginary
apostles, prophets, and even deities.
The only difference between us is, that <i>you</i> allow
several of such patients to go at large and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>do mischief in the world, because <i>you</i> think it
necessary to have fully <i>ascertained</i> that a man is
deranged before you confine him; whereas we
think it right to confine him at once, as soon as
it is made evident that he is <i>either</i> deranged,
or an impostor, or able (as a divine messenger,
and therefore under a miraculous dispensation,)
to obtain immediate release. In all these
cases (and there can be no other supposition)
we hold it manifestly allowable, and consequently
right, to confine him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in the course of this conversation,
after the discussion of the foregoing and several
kindred subjects, that one of the company made
a remark respecting the views which had been
presented to him of the history of Europe since
their departure from it, as compared with its
state at that time, and the general history of
mankind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our founders,” he said, “appear to have
had peculiar advantages, from which we have,
I trust, derived some fruit, in the particular
time and circumstances of their change of abode.
They left Europe at the exciting period of the
Reformation, which had shaken the hold that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>ancient opinions, habits, and institutions had
long maintained over the human mind; when
men’s energies were roused, their imaginations
kindled, and all their feelings highly stimulated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not to be wondered at, that, at such a
period, many of the results should have followed
which appear in Europe to have actually
ensued. Some, we know, ran into the wildest
extravagancies of innovation. Again, the fierce
and obstinate opposition of others to every
change—besides the malevolent passions thus
called into play—appears to have driven many
of the reformers to still greater excesses, or to
have hardened them into greater pertinacity.
And, moreover, many, frightened at the prospect
of extravagant innovations, or weary of
perpetual change, seem to have resolutely stopped
short before they had fairly followed out
their own just principles of a complete reformation;
or even relapsed into the prejudices they
had renounced, embraced anew the errors which
had been exploded, and returned to the corrupt
systems, which were standing, as it were,
with their gates open to receive them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Our founders, on the other hand, after they
had received the salutary stimulus, were removed
out of the way of most of these evils by
their retirement hither. Withdrawn from persecution
and oppression, and furious controversy
and religious wars, they were secured in
a great measure from the fanaticism and the
unchristian bitterness of spirit which these are
so often found to generate. They were kept
out of the way, again, of all temptation to
return to the corrupt systems they had renounced,
since no example of these remained
among them; and were left calmly and peaceably
to make trials of the application of their
principles in practice, and to modify at leisure
those principles according to the dictates of
experience.”</p>

<p class='c011'>[Such is the substance of the conversation
that passed on these subjects. The language
is of course altered, in this and in the other
conversations recorded, in order to render it
more readily intelligible. It is, indeed, almost
a <i>translation</i> that is given; not, indeed, from a
foreign tongue, but from a peculiar dialect of
English.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>The greater part of what was said by the
travellers, except what was necessary to make
the answers intelligible, has been omitted, for
the reasons already stated.]</p>

<p class='c009'>Preachers.—Divine Service.—Divisions of the Bible.—Funeral
Service.—Burial in Cities.—Absurd Interments.—Monuments.—Private
Mausoleums.—Harmless Absurdities.—Church Endowments.—State
of the Clergy.—Religious Communities.—Admission
Fees to Institutions.—Ecclesiastical Societies.</p>

<p class='c010'>It happened in the earlier part of their visit,
when the travellers were less familiar with the
peculiarities of the Southland phraseology, that
they were inquiring one day whether there was
in the neighbourhood where they then were
any <i>preacher</i> of more than ordinary celebrity,
and were surprised at being answered that
there were no preachers within two hundred
miles. As they had, before this, attended public
worship, they perceived at once that there
must be some misapprehension. They found
that “a preacher” denotes—according to its
primitive sense—what <i>we</i> understand by a
<i>missionary</i> among the heathen. “Expounding,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“lecturing,” “discoursing,” are the terms
used by them to denote what we call “preaching.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the difficulty was surmounted which
they felt at first in following what was said,
from the novelty to them of the dialect, they
were very well pleased with some discourses
they heard, which appeared to them sensible,
pious, and instructive; but they never heard
any one who came up to the idea of what we
call “a fine preacher,” or “a very nice man,”
for the reason already mentioned in the notice
of their parliamentary debates.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strangers were at first puzzled by another
peculiarity which they met with in their
attendance on divine service. The minister referred,
not to the chapter and verse of any
book of Scripture, but to the page and line, or
rather to what are <i>called</i> pages and lines; that
is, certain equal divisions, which are indeed the
actual pages and lines of their large editions
of the Bible, but of course do not correspond
with those of a different size. These artificial
pages and lines, as they may be called, are
marked by horizontal (<span class='fraction'>P. 25,<br>─</span>) and vertical (<span class='fraction'>L. 5.<br>│</span>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>lines, respectively. The origin of the custom,
it seems, was, that their first edited translation
having been <i>paged</i>, and subsequent editions
being, for some time, fac-similes of it in point
of size, the custom grew up,—indeed there is
reason to think it was designedly encouraged,—of
making the references to pages and
lines; and these same arbitrary divisions were
accordingly retained in subsequent editions.
Generally, though not always, the chapters
and verses are marked in the margin, for the
convenience of scholars who may wish to
consult some of the old editions of the Bible
in the learned languages, or who may be
reading, in old editions, some works of the
earlier divines containing references to those
divisions. For their own use, they consider
their method as preferable to ours, inasmuch
as their divisions are exactly <i>equal</i>;
serve perfectly for the <i>use</i> intended,—that of
facility of <i>reference</i>;—and carry on the face
of them a plain indication that they are designed
for no <i>other</i> use, and therefore cannot
mislead the reader into the notion of their having
a connexion with the sense, and being the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>work of the sacred writers, or designed by editors
as a suitable distribution of the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The funeral service varies in a slight degree
in the rituals of the several churches; but in
one point they all agree,—that in the prayers
used, and in any discourse delivered on the
occasion, no allusion is made to the particular
individual deceased. The shortness and uncertainty
of life generally,—a future state, and the
requisite preparation for it,—with other such
general topics, are the only ones allowed to be
introduced. Any mention of, or allusion to a
particular individual, in the way of panegyric
or otherwise, on such an occasion, would be
regarded as invidious and highly indecorous.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When a man,” they said, “has departed
this life, to pronounce upon his condition in
another world, or to pray that that condition
may be altered, we regard as presumptuous,
and especially unsuitable in a Christian congregation
assembled for a religious purpose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Their cemeteries are never contiguous to
their places of ordinary religious worship, nor
within any of their towns or villages; but at
some little distance, and generally within, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>adjoining, some park or other public pleasure-ground.
They imagined it must be deleterious
to the health of the Europeans to inhabit
towns, the site of which consists in great measure
of stratum upon stratum of decomposing
animal matter, continually renewed and continually
stirred up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are well aware,” they said, “what gave
rise to the practice. It was the notion entertained
by our ancestors (and, it should seem,
by some of their European descendants) that
demons are scared away by the sound of
church-bells, by lustrations of holy-water, and
the like; and that the departed, accordingly,
derive from such things some kind of comfort
and protection. We hold, however, (and we
hoped our European brethren had long since
come to the same conclusion,) that the only
injuries of which a corpse is in any danger
are from the plough or the spade, the carrion-crow,
the swine, or the wolf;” (so they call the
Dingo, the New Holland wild dog;) “and that
protection from these is to be found in stone
walls, boards, and mounds of earth, not in any
religious ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“As for spiritual danger, we conceive that
the body becomes exempt from everything of
that kind, precisely at the moment life departs
from it; and, accordingly, that religious appliances
<i>then</i> employed resemble the practice of
the savages, who clothe the dead body of a
friend in the best skin robes they can procure,
and bury it, surrounded with a store of
food, and with all the implements of hunting
and fishing. If these poor heathens were to
go a step beyond this in absurdity,—if they
were to refuse to supply a famished companion
while living with needful food, clothing,
and shelter, and then, as soon as he was dead,
and no longer sensible of cold and hunger,
were to <i>begin</i> to supply his dead body with
provisions, which it could no longer use,—they
would then be treating him, as some of our
European forefathers treated themselves; who
seldom or never, during their lives, frequented
a house of worship to any profitable purpose,
while they might have derived benefit
from their attendance; but reflected with satisfaction
on the idea that their dead bodies
would be brought into the house of worship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and perhaps interred there, as soon as the
time should have passed when their presence
there would be of any avail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is partly in order to guard against any
relapse into such superstitions that we make
it a rule never even to bring a dead body
within the walls of a place of worship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There are no monuments in their burial-grounds
beyond plain slabs, containing the
name of the person whose remains are interred,
with the necessary dates, &#38;c. But in other
places they have monuments of the nature of
cenotaphs, in memory of persons who have
been in any manner so distinguished as to be
allowed this posthumous honour, by the direction,
or with the permission, of the civil authorities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Statues are sometimes erected, in places of
public resort, to men of high eminence: but
usually the memorial consists in an inscription
(sometimes accompanied with decorative sculpture)
placed on the <i>house</i> in which the person
in question was born, or lived, or died; or
on any public building, such as a college, or
library, or the like, which was in any way connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>with his useful labours. In all cases,
any monument so placed as to meet the public
eye, cannot be erected without the permission
of the proper authorities; whose approval of
the inscription, decorations, and all the particulars,
is essentially requisite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If a man chooses,” said they, “to erect
within his own private house or garden the
most extravagant mausoleum in honour of
some ancestor, and to cover it with inscriptions
of the most fulsome and groundless panegyric,
he is quite at liberty to do so. We
do not profess to make laws to prevent a
man from playing the fool in private; but
whatever is obtruded on the <i>public</i> eye is fairly
placed under public control. And monuments,”
they added, “when thus duly regulated,
constitute a useful kind of record of
departed worth, and of the several degrees
and kinds of it; the utility of which record
would be greatly impaired if mixed up and
interlined, as it were, with the aberrations of
the private partiality, or ostentation, or absurdity
of individuals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the same,” they said, “with titles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of honour, and decorations of office borne by
the living. If a man has a fancy to wear in
private a dressing-gown decorated like a robe
of state,—to have his easy-chair in his study
made after the fashion of a regal throne,—to
make his own family in private call him your
lordship or your majesty, or to amuse himself
at his own home with any such folly, the
laws would not take cognizance of his harmless
absurdities; but if he were to do all this in
public, he would not be allowed thus to go
about to break down all distinctions of rank,
dignity, and office, by assuming what did not
belong to him. Now, we consider that monumental
honours, when displayed before the
public, are a kind of public posthumous dignities;
over which, accordingly, the Public has
a just right of control.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>All the churches are possessed of endowments
(greater or less); generally, though not
exclusively, land, which are held by bodies of
trustees (variously constituted), recognised as
corporations; these receive and distribute the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>revenues, and, in some churches, have the nomination
to benefices; in others, this is placed
in their hands conjointly with the overseer
(somewhat answering to bishop), or council
of overseers, of the church.</p>

<p class='c011'>What is called among us the ‘voluntary system,’—the
maintenance of the minister by the
voluntary contributions of his congregation,—is
not only unknown, but distinctly prohibited, in
all the churches, by a regulation which forbids
the minister even to accept any kind of gratuity
from his flock, or to derive any profit
from the letting of seats, or any other such
source.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Campbell, a clergyman and theological
professor at one of their seminaries, from whom
among others their information on these subjects
was derived, observed, that he was not
sure (as the experiment never had been—and
he hoped never would be—tried among them)
whether any of their States would even tolerate
a religion whose ministers were to be maintained
by the congregations as hired servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A pastor,” said he, “appointed by the people,—which
is bad enough,—or removable by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the people,—which is still much worse,—or
supported by the gifts of the people,—which is
far worst of all,—has everything to encounter
that can tend to make him what he should not
be; and that can expose him to suspicion of
this, even if undeserved; and that can lower
his character, and lessen his deserved influence,
if he is such as he ought to be. No plan,” he
added, “could possibly be devised more calculated
for debasing and corrupting both the clergy
and people, and for perverting religion, and
turning it into a source of evil, instead of good,
to both. The people would be taught to seek
for, and their pastor (I should rather say, their
<i>servant</i>) tempted to supply,—instead of honest
and profitable instruction and seasonable admonitions,—flattery
to their prejudices,—indulgence
to their vices,—encouragement to their
superstitions,—assistance and counsel in political
schemes and party machinations,—amusing
theatrical excitement to itching ears,—and flattering
delusions, as opiates to the soul, instead
of wholesome truth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On its being remarked, in reply, that many
persons in England contend for the benefit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>making a minister’s income depend, in some
degree at least, on his own exertions, and are
accustomed to adduce instances of the inefficiency
of some whose revenues are secure and
independent, Dr. Campbell replied that it is
true such instances do occasionally occur, and
are much to be deplored.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, after all,” added he, “we ought to
remember that, bad as it is for a minister to be
useless, <i>useless</i> is the <i>best</i> thing <i>such</i> a minister
<i>can</i> be. A clergyman who is capable of being
stimulated to exertion <i>only</i> by motives of interest,
and is careless and apathetic when <i>that</i>
is wanting, had much better be <i>left</i> careless.
When gain does rouse such a man to exertion,
he will most likely exert himself as a
demagogue or a mountebank. A man whom
neither conscientious motives, nor desire for the
respect and esteem of good men, can rouse to
efficiency in doing good, is very likely to become
an active doer of evil, if he have any
dormant energies and talents that can be roused
at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On inquiring whether the governments, accordingly,
insist on paying all ministers of religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>who are not otherwise provided for, the
travellers were informed that Government never
pays any. Occasionally, indeed, grants of state-lands
are made to various public institutions,
and to religious ones among the rest; but this
is always by a distinct act of each legislature
in reference to the circumstances of each case
that is brought before them. But any persons
who can raise among themselves, and from
their well-wishers, funds towards building and
endowing chapels, &#38;c. and who prefer forming
themselves into a distinct religious community,
never find any considerable difficulty in obtaining
a charter of incorporation for such trustees
as they appoint. And it has often happened
that, by accessions of donations or bequests
from time to time, and also of members, some,
both ecclesiastical and also academical corporations,
have, from small beginnings, grown
into considerable importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The voluntary system,” said Dr. Campbell,
“which we condemn, is not voluntary gifts
towards a common fund for an endowment <i>in
perpetuity</i>, but voluntary payments from time
to time to a particular minister for his yearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>or weekly maintenance by his people,—by those,
I was going to say, who are placed under him;
but, it should rather be, <i>under whom he is
placed</i>.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>It is a custom, it seems, for those admitted
on any academical or ecclesiastical foundation
as partakers of the endowment, to contribute
themselves towards the fund, by paying a certain
admission-fee, as it may be called, on
entrance. In the greater part of the institutions
whose endowments are sufficient for their
objects this is little more than a nominal payment,
a sort of ceremonial acknowledgment,
trifling in amount: but in less amply endowed
societies it is something considerable; in those
whose common funds are still smaller, it is
more; and in some,—chiefly such as are in
their infancy,—a man has to pay, on being
admitted a fellow, an associate, a pastor, or
whatever it may be, of one of these colleges, or
churches, &#38;c. a sum equal to, or even exceeding,
what his maintenance derived from the society
will probably cost, according to the principles
of annuity-office calculations. In such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>case, the advantages sought by the man or
woman who is a candidate for admission (for
there are several female institutions of this
kind) are the pleasure and honour of being
admitted into a society, perhaps in high repute
for the intelligence, worth, knowledge,
and agreeableness of its members,—(the same
objects that make it in England often a matter
of earnest competition to be elected into a particular
club,)—the conveniences, sometimes, of
a common library, museum, table, &#38;c.; so that
a person who may have paid more than he
or she will actually cost the society, may yet
have made a very good bargain in the purchase
of a comfortable and respectable maintenance;
and, lastly, the advantage of the purchase of
a kind of <i>annuity</i>; paying down a certain sum,
and being secured, as far as a decent subsistence,
against all chances, by insuring a maintenance
during life, or during single-life, according
to the regulations of each society.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fellowships, &#38;c. of <i>colleges</i> are, for the
most part, held during celibacy only; and some
of them make little or no provision for any but
those actually resident. Persons admitted on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the foundation of <i>ecclesiastical</i> societies, as ministers
or other officers, receive a stipend for
life, unless regularly expelled for misconduct.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>There are several further particulars relating
to these matters, on which, as has been already
mentioned, Mr. Sibthorpe hoped to obtain
fuller information.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>Letter of Paul Wilkins.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We shall close these extracts with a letter,
which we have had permission to publish, from
one of the exploring party, Paul Wilkins, the
sailor formerly mentioned, written after his return
to Sidney to his parents in England. Our
reader will perceive from this letter that a part
only of the travellers had returned; two of
them having determined to prolong their stay
in the newly-discovered colony, in order to
gain a fuller acquaintance with its singular
customs and institutions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The letter is printed exactly from the manuscript,
because, if any alterations had been made,—even
though extending only to the style and
orthography,—or any omissions even of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>most trivial matters, the reader might have been
left in doubt what degree of liberty might have
been taken with the original. And errors in
language or in spelling, such as may be expected
in the composition of a person of ordinary
education in humble life, can excite no
disgust or contempt; and must disarm criticism,
when occurring in a familiar letter designed for
the perusal of his own domestic circle, by one
who never thought of aspiring to come before
the public as an author. Taking into account
the station and circumstances of the writer,
there is nothing, we conceive, that will be
thought to do discredit to his head or heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This comes with my Love, hoping to find
you a live &#38; all well, as it leaves me thank
God, which I never expected sometimes to come
Back a live from a long and peralous Expidition
into the Interier. But am happy to say
we suckseded &#38; have been to the most Wonderfull
country I ever see in all my Voyages. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>sho’d never have done if I was to go to tell you
every thing, but as their is a Vessel just going
to Sail, and I can send this by a safe Hand
I take up my pen to give you some a count
of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hardly know how to be gin my Head is
so full of all the queer things I see. The two
Lieut. Smiths who you remember my shewing
you one of them last time I was at Home, fine
dashing felowes they are as ever trod a plank,
they and Mr. Sibthorp of the Colony and Mr.
Jones, they ingag’d me as a tendant to exploar
in the Interier on a new plan of their own.
They said as no great Navigable rivers has
been found by coasting Expiditions, the only
chance was to try in land, and if they met with
any considarable Stream to follow it till it come
either to the Sea or a great Lake which some
thought there is a great in land Sea in the
Interier. So says they cout kick out they
wou’d find wether their is one or no. So off
we sat &#38; took with us the frame work of a
Canoe flat bottomed by reason of the Shallows
were we was to Embark. And when we come
to the Lake which it is a kind of swamp like,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>more weeds than Water, we put our canoe to
gether &#38; coverd it with Bark of Trees &#38; got
in our Stores. Their was no room for much
Provisions but we trusted to our Guns &#38; Fishing
tackle, all the Party are pretty good shots,
&#38; your Humble Servant no bad Hand tho’ I
say it at striking Fish or Hook &#38; Line.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was hard work for some days, we were
like a dab chick scufling &#38; flutering along
among the Flags &#38; Mud, &#38; then we got into
clearer water &#38; made Sail at a good rate, &#38;
then into a River which we thought this will
bring us to the sea, But no we got into more
Lakes &#38; swamps, and then river a gain &#38; so
on, &#38; then we had to get out and track the
Canoe with Ropes to steddy its coarse along
the rapids, &#38; once we was forced to carry it
overland to a void the Falls. And some times
we never thought but what we sho’d be lost an
starved in the Wilds, all the country round
nothing but Rocks &#38; Sands. But we all kep
up a good Heart, no want of Pluck among
the Gent men, and I can’t say we wanted for
Vittles only going without Bread mostly thanks
to the Fish &#38; Wildfowl.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“I sho’d never have done if I was to tell
you All. Well after better than a Month were
do you think we come to at last, why to a
Colony of White men, that had been hid like
in the Wilds best part of three Hundred years
&#38; never seen no Christian peple all that time
only them selves. Its true I a sure you, &#38;
its compewted theirs nearer 4 milian than three
totell number of Soles in the Country. How
serprised we was to see em &#38; hear em hail
us in English, for their of English Dissent
mostly only some mixture of Duch &#38; German
&#38; Swiss. Its an odd sort of English too they
speak, but we got usd to it in a little wile,
their lingo isnt worse than broaed Scoch or
Yorkshire.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well you may be sure if they wonderd to
see us we was wondring how they come their.
And it seems they came out in former times
when their was great trubles in Europe to
make a settlement and live in Piece &#38; Quiet,
And their Vessels was driven on the coast, &#38;
they got a shore &#38; landed all their stores
safe, &#38; then went up &#38; setled in the Interier,
being they found the coast unhealthy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Its a fine Country they have got to now, as big
I am thinking as Great Briton &#38; Ireland put
to gether, for they arnt no ways prest for room,
but make a new Setlement were they likes.
They treated us very kindly in deed &#38; seamed
glad to see us as if we had been brethren like,
as they say’d. And very good Towns &#38; good
Living their is among them, tho’ they arnt
quite so high civilised as English Peple, as
stands to Reason being they have livd so long
out of the World like.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And some queer ways they have among
them to be sure, quite different from ours.
Theirs not a bit of Bacca to be had for love
nor money, nor Grog neither, as for Rum or
Whisky or the like they dont know what it
means. I usd to tell em how theyd stare if
they was to come among us &#38; see writen up
every were Dealer in Tea Coffee To Bacco &#38;
Snuff, &#38; Dealer in Spirtuos Liquors, for they
havent nothing of the kind. But how ever
they have good ale that I must say &#38; Wine &#38;
Cyder to plenty, &#38; very hospy table peple, but
no way given to liquor, I never see a drunken
Man all the time, &#38; they say its like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Savages to get drunk. And theirs truth in
that I can testyfy, for those Black felows will
drink as long as they can stand in the Colony
and longer two if they can come at liquor.
They say wo’dnt you reckon it a Great Miss
fortune if you was to go out of your Mind &#38;
have to be put in a mad House, and if a Man
gets drunk he goes out of his mind, &#38; ought to
be shut up in confinement, &#38; they say if a Man
was a reglar drunkard they wou’d shut him
up two.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They are good farmers I must say &#38; good
breeders too. you tell Mr. Evans, &#38; my respects
to him hope he is well &#38; all his family,
I haven’t for got all the farming I learnt under
him tho’ I was but a lad, I wish he cou’d see
the fine cows like the Holderness in the low
grounds, and a breed like the alderney on the
Mountaneous parts, &#38; sheep to both long &#38;
short wool, such fleeces as I think he never see.
But as for Mutton I can’t speak, for only think
they never heard tell of Mutton, for theyd
think it a most as big a sin to kill a Sheep or a
Bulock &#38; eat it as we shou’d to kill a Christian
&#38; eat his flesh like the Cannibles does.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Theirs a queer peple for you. But they goes
out hunting the Wild Cattle and wild Hog,
theyve plenty of them, &#38; they dont object by
no means to a bit of wild pork or beef.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A nother fancy of theirs is they never will
have Joints of meat servd up nor any thing
done hole, not a pig or a foul or a fish if its ever
so small, but all done in chops or Hash or the
like of that. And they said we must be like
the savages to feed on hole carcasses &#38; Limbs
of Annimals, as Egles &#38; Woolves does. They
calls a Dingo a woolf, thats the Newholland
wild dog.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We went out with them several times,
Hunting &#38; shooting. They have guns only
not so good as ours, but they shoot with Bows
&#38; Arows be sides, &#38; wonderful good shots
some of em is. Sometimes when we went out
we had only to look on at them shooting, because
they woudnt have no firing for fear of
scaring away the game. But sometimes we
had a grand Battoo &#38; then all had guns &#38; our
Gentmen shot as well as the best of them.
Mr. Jones made a present of his double baril
Gun to one Gentman of the Country &#38; mightyly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>pleased he was, for their workmen arnt
up to a double Baril. And I shewd them a
thing or too about the build &#38; rigging of their
fishing-boats that they wasnt up to. And very
great full &#38; handsome they was I must say,
for they gave me as much in their money &#38;
other things as comes to better than 50£ besides
several curosities as a sort of Keep sake
like, I got new rigged from top to toe all in
cloaths of their fashion hat &#38; all &#38; a comical
hat you’d think if you was to see it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mr. Jones he said at first all the peple
looked like musheroms they have hats as big
as a small table, but that is to keep off the
sun which it is very glearing in new Holland.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then it was so strange to hear all about
Kings &#38; Sennates &#38; Parliments &#38; Piers &#38;
Lord mayers, just like being in a new World
like. The thing is they have eleven states
something like the States of America, only
some is kingdoms &#38; some is republicks &#38; what
not. I harly knew weather I was a sleep or a
wake, it seam’d a kind of dream like.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then I went several times to parties of
pleasure something in the Nature of our Wakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>they calls them Rebels &#38; I a tended my Masters
to wait upon them at some of the Rebels of
the Gentry, and high &#38; low their was plenty
of mirth at all. But the first time I went with
the Gentmen I thought their was to be a Ball
or the like of that just as the gentlefolks have
in England, &#38; sure anuff their was Gentmen
&#38; Lords &#38; Lady’s a playing at Bowls or something
like, &#38; some shooting at a target, &#38; some
at other games in the nature of tenis &#38; trap-ball, all as fond of the sport as boys &#38; girls, &#38;
they all grown up Gent folks &#38; no mistake.
And the best of it is they thinks dansing is
only fit for children &#38; Savages. It’s as true
as I am sitting hear.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Its a fine country as I told you for pastur
&#38; corn &#38; for gardens &#38; orcheards to, &#38; we see
a good shew for fruit, only they havent got all
the fruits as are in our colonies, being I suppose
they wasnt known in former Times. And
they are great Hands at Iragation as its calld
thats leting the Water over the Land same as
our Water Meadows, They’ll dam up a stream
were it comes down from the high Ground,
&#38; So let it off by Canalls, &#38; smaller Canalls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>out of those &#38; so on, &#38; then lower down there
will be a nother dam, &#38; so the River keeps
wasting a way as it goes on, &#38; some never gets
to the Sea a tall. And its my belief they are
one cause why no body has found any large
river falling into the sea, for they say themselves,
some that was in former times good sizd
Rivers flowing to’rds the coast are now next
to nothing. There is a great many Lakes tho’
&#38; a sight of fine Fish in them, its wonderful to
see how some of them will shoot fish in the
shalows with Bow an arow. I never see the
like, but for striking them with a spear I
was up to that as well as them, &#38; hook &#38;
line two.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And they always serves up fish for second
coarse, when theirs any meat for dinner or foul
as their generly is, fresh or salt, pork beaf
ducks &#38; Geese plenty, then up comes fish
after meat, &#38; soupe last of all, &#38; only think
chese the first thing of all to begin dinner.
They say its a wonder how any Body can degest
chese after a Meal, &#38; to be sure there is
a saying that chese dejest all things but it self.
But its all contrary to our ways as many things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>is hear, perhaps youll think it stands to reason
were the north wind is hot &#38; the south cold
&#38; Chrismas come in summer &#38; the shortest
day falls in June, tho’ the folks dont walk with
their heads down &#38; heals up in the air neither
as the old nurses used to tell us.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well I cant tell you all nor half, but I
must tell you of one great curosity we all went
to see, near the town of Bath called Mount
perril, its a good high mountain &#38; they say
was in times past a Burning mountain, &#38;
there is great caverns in the side, &#38; out of
some of them their ishues a noxuous vaper
like what Ive heard talk of in coal pits wich
they calls it chokdamp. We went a long with
the worshipfull Christopher Adamson one of
the Sennaters as they call im of the state of
Bath, &#38; stood a top of a cliff over one they
calld the Gobbling cave, &#38; let down in an iron
Great a litle heap of dry chips &#38; brush wood
all a light &#38; blazing, &#38; wen it got into the
caves mouth out it went as black as night jest
as if you’d sousd it into the Sea, only there
was no Hiss, and they said if any body was to
go close to the mouth at some times hed drop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>down sufficated by the vaper. And in times
past they said it was a fassion for Gentmen &#38;
Ladies two, if they had a Quarril to challenge
one a nother to go their, by way of fighting a
Dual, they calld it an Or Dual &#38; they behovd
to go to gather past the Gobbling cave
&#38; take their chance wich of ’em sho’d be Sufficated,
&#38; some times both. I said I thou’t it better
than that or pistols either, to go and box it
out fairly &#38; then shake hands, &#38; be freinds,
tho’ to be sure that wouldnt do for the Ladys.
But however theres no Or Duals now no kind
of Duals at all their now a days. Their all
to gather a very peicable well behaved set of
peple as ever I see, And their a well looking
peple to, tho’ some of them has a lick of the
Tar brush as they say in the West Indies that
is a mixture of Black blood in them, but they
ar’nt no ways asham’d of it, for they say their
not savages at any rate, &#38; all men are children
of Adam.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well I must conclude tho’ I havnt tolld
you half what I see, So Mr. Sibthorpe he was
for staying a bit longer if he could but let all
our freinds know we were safe, for they wo’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>be sure to give us up for lost. So it was
setteld for Mr. Sibthorpe to stay &#38; Lieut
Robt Smith, to stay behind &#38; the rest of us
to return, and a long with us young Squire
Adamson a son of the old sennator. And
there was several more talkd of coming to
visit Sidney &#38; paraps England to, along with
Mr. Sibthorpe. Well it was about six weeks
in all we’d been thear, geting toards the latter
part of Octr wen we set off to return and
the peple had sent a party on befour, with two
Canoes &#38; provisions to wait for us some way
on, &#38; we went over land on horse back by a
short cut that the Hunters knew of. And
that saved us a good bit. And when we imbarked
we knew the rout &#38; saved a deal of
time that we had lost in coming. But then
again we was forced to land in some places
were the water was to shalow, or dried up
since we was thear be fore. And some hard
work we had to get a long over the rocks &#38;
weeds. So after great fatigue it was passed
the middle of Novr before we ariv’d, which we
did all well thank God, &#38; glad our friends
was to see us, for they given us up for Lost.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“And so now as their’s a Vessel to Sail Day
after To-morrow Morning I send this in haste
hoping it will find you well &#38; my Love to sister
Jenkyns and her Husband hope is doing
well &#38; the boys who I supose they are grown

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
